Not only are fundamentalists on the rise but also many competing brands of spirituality are now widely disseminated through media, film, best selling fiction and television. While most orthodox religions have always used ritual and performance, telecommunications and televisual effects are transforming religion into religiosity. ‘The return of religion’ has become an issue. Jean Franco is currently Professor Emeritus at Columbia University. She is the winner of the PEN 1996 award for lifetime contribution to the dissemination of Latin American literature in English and has been recognized by the Chilean and Venezuelan governments for advanced scholarship on Latin American literature in the United States.

520 bb $a The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of
artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando
Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used
performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the
most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated
strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all
its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of
all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that
eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator.
Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of
spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to
interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the
citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and
semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs. On July,
12th, 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago,
dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society.
This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (La
Moneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic government
and the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Through
this ‘acción sobre arte y política’, CADA reconstructed the political
trauma of 1973, while proposing a new critical political perspective. The
flyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s right
to a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public was
capable of instating an entirely new concept of art — one that could
overcome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life. Here
shown is a scrolling text introducing the performance (in English).
