Not only are fundamentalists on the rise but also many competing brands of spirituality are now widely disseminated through media, film, best selling fiction and television. While most orthodox religions have always used ritual and performance, telecommunications and televisual effects are transforming religion into religiosity. ‘The return of religion’ has become an issue. Jean Franco is currently Professor Emeritus at Columbia University. She is the winner of the PEN 1996 award for lifetime contribution to the dissemination of Latin American literature in English and has been recognized by the Chilean and Venezuelan governments for advanced scholarship on Latin American literature in the United States.",English,"Franco, Jean| Religion and Telecommunications| Return of Religion| Hemispheric Institute| Spectacles of Religiosities",,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

One of themost important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporatedstrategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to allits ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions ofall politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice thateradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator.Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice ofspectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended tointerrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of thecitizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized andsemantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs. On July,12th, 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago,dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society.This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (LaMoneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic governmentand the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Throughthis ‘acción sobre arte y política’, CADA reconstructed the politicaltrauma of 1973, while proposing a new critical political perspective. Theflyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s rightto a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public wascapable of instating an entirely new concept of art — one that couldovercome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life.
