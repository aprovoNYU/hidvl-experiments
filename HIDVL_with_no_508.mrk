=520  \\$aMartha Wilson explores the effects of camera presence in this video compilation of her solo performances. She uses film as a political medium to record the temporal, visceral, and spacial dimensions of her subjectivity as a female artist. As both filmmaker and performer, Wilson asserts political autonomy over her image and counters phallocentric notions of the female body. She reverses the male gaze by becoming a subject of her own desire, while challenging standards of beauty. Wilson’s subjective agency places her identity as a woman artist front and center, a radical position that challenged the aesthetic practices of male conceptual artists in the 1970s.
=520  \\$aMartha Wilson is a pioneering gallery director and feminist artist who creates innovative photographic and video works that explore her female subjectivity. Wilson founded Franklin Furnace in 1976, an artist-run space that champions the exploration, promotion, and preservation of artist books, temporary installation, performance art, as well as online works. She has been described by New York Times critic Holland Cotter as one of 'the half-dozen most important people for art in downtown Manhattan in the 1970s.' Wilson has received fellowships for performance art from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts; Bessie and Obie awards for commitment to artists’ freedom of expression; a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts; a Richard Massey Foundation-White Box Arts and Humanities Award; and an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University.$uhttp://www.marthawilson.com

=518  \\$aRecorded at Théâtre de la Tempête, Paris, France.
=520  \\$aThe play ‘Murro em ponta de faca’ was written by Boal in 1971, during his exile. It is a story of the military dictatorship in Brazil and in Latin America. The story shows a group of exiled Brazilians that go through the social and individual experience of living, against their will, in a different homeland - in this case Chile, Argentina, and France. The group is formed by three couples of different social classes and ideologies (intellectuals, workers, and bourgeois) who are forced to live in the same space and face their differences and lack of freedom. The play deals with broad issues of exile, resulting in exclusion, denial, control, and intolerance, but also the fight for affirmation and resistance.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed. Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled. His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed.
=520  \\$aThe Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems. The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.

=520  \\$aMartha Wilson presents a selection of artists’ books from Franklin Furnace's archive in Artists' Books Discussion at Queens College (1985). Wilson explains the importance of collecting artists’ books as other cultural institutions fail to include them as viable artworks due to their experimental form and political content. She traces the history of artists’ books from Futurism, Conceptual Art, and Fluxus, defining the avant-garde medium at the intersection of art and literature. Wilson discusses the visual, poetical, and conceptual arrangement of artists’ books and notes how these elements are performative on the page. She is later joined by Franklin Furnace Curator, Matthew Hogan, to present a selection of artists’ books from the organization’s permanent collection. This video features artists’ books by Charles Henri Ford, Kevin Osborn, Fluxus, Art Life Magazine, Ed Ruscha, Don Celender, Mark Berghash, John Baldessari, Eleanor Antin, Scott Hyde, The Apple Magazine, Warren Lehrer, Jessie Affelder, Sol Lewitt, Dick Higgins, and David Horton, among others.
=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas. The organization has developed a place in art history for artists’ books, temporary installation art, and performance art. www.franklinfurnace.org

=520  \\$aThe Brooklyn College series features video material of two full days of workshop with Augusto Boal in 1988. This is a video documentation of the second day of workshop, dedicated mostly to Forum Theatre practices. Augusto Boal leads general exercises and invites participants to think about how to apply Theatre of the Oppressed techniques in a classroom setting.

=518  \\$aRecorded at Brooklyn College, New York, NY, USA, on January 21, 1988.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal gives a lecture at Brooklyn College on the theater of the oppressed. He states, “The theatre that I do is to show that every human being uses the same languages as the actor on stage (passion, movements, and costumes depending on the scenery), but the actor has consciousness of it.” He touches on the inevitability of “doing” theatre: that in fact once we learn to speak the language of theater, it can be rehearsed in real life in order to “analyze possibilities.” Lastly, in relation to the spectator, Boal argues that they should not be passive, but active and transgressive, seeking to interfere and modify the performance that is presented to them.
=520  \\$aIn the second part of the workshop Boal asks groups of five to present images of oppression, with 41 groups participating in total. Once this collection of images of oppression are presented, Boal asks if the participants identify themselves with the characters. He has them participate in an exercise of interaction involving movement, stillness, speaking, and silence.
=520  \\$a“To do is the best way to tell.” In the third part of the workshop Boal shows photos of families in other countries, such as Spain, USA, Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Sweden, and Egypt, while remarking on each country's history. After this exercise, Boal asks the participants to think about what they want to talk or fight about in preparation for the second day of the workshop, in which they will improvise these ideas and themes through a Forum Theater exercise.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal was an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be one of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination.

This exhibition, held at Franklin Furnace, featured an array of books, audio, and videotapes of concrete poetry—a form of poetry depicted through semantic, visual, and phonetic elements of language. It drew from Franklin Furnace's artists' books collection, the nation's largest repository of the avant-garde book form, and also included a selection of materials on loan from anonymous donors. The works featured in "Concrete Poetry" (1988) expand upon the motifs of pop-up poems, constellation poems, and typopoems explored in "Concrete Poetry: The Early Years" (1986), an exhibition organized by Franklin Furnace and presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This video includes poetic works by Augusto de Campos, Emmett Williams, Paul de Vree, Jiri Kolar, and Wolfgang Schmidt.

=520  \\$aThis performance begins with Boal retelling how, when he was elected to office in Rio de Janeiro, he began the Legislative Theater to organize groups of people to help them to fight oppression through theater. Having marginalized people participate in the theater and express their problems, Boal brought attention to these issues through his political position and projects of law. The efforts of the Theater of the Oppressed to make substantial political change and extend the potential of democracy, led to the passing of 13 laws in Rio. In this performance, Boal recreates the years of the Legislative Theater by breaking the participants into groups and giving them a socio-political issue to improvise and act on, such as minimum wage. As the 5 plays happen simultaneously, Boal offers 'We present the problem, but the solution comes from you,' to re-enforce that the political power comes from the people as they express their frustrations, create and propose legislation.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal was an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination.

=518  \\$aPerformed in La Paz, Bolivia, in the late 1990s.
=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed in a public square in La Paz, Bolivia. Mujeres Creando’s proposal considers that ‘the street is the space where we make sense, where be become full of meaning;’ thus, the streets are the most important stage to perform political gestures and to enact political actions. Through the simple but powerful act of setting a dining table in the middle of the streets, Mujeres Creando bring together the private and the public, and reconfigure the structures of power that constrain people’s freedom. The acción of sharing food with the passers-by not only addresses the fact that we all are equals and part of the same society, but also invites to remember that sharing communal activities is an act of love.
=520  \\$aMujeres Creando is a feminist anarchist movement created in 1990 in La Paz, Bolivia. It is comprised of women of different cultural, social, and ethnic origins, and explores creativity as an instrument of resistance and social participation. The three women who founded this communitarian proposal (Maria Galindo, Julieta Paredes, and Monica Mendoza) worked together to recover the public space that the patriarchal system appropriated. In this sense, the group does not only struggle for women’s rights or issues that affect women, but also against other problems that affect society. The ways of expression of Mujeres Creando are graffiti, creativity, ongoing public debates, and acciones, along with a constant presence in the streets to reclaim a voice and participation in the public sphere. Since its beginnings, the group has been part of international gatherings, dialoguing with different feminist tendencies and thus being able to build its ideological identity within the autonomous feminism, in contrast and in connection with global struggles. In April 2001, due to ethical and political disagreements, there was a division in the group, which brought the necessity to differentiate names. In spite of this divergence, Maria Galindo continues working with Mujeres Creando in Bolivia.

=520  \\$aTim Miller’s Stretch Marks (1990) is a call to action regarding sexual politics in the height of the AIDS epidemic. Miller employs a queer temporality by relaying his coming-out in high school to his present identity as a gay man, artist, and citizen. He addresses the political climate of HIV/AIDS in the United States and how the disease has led to homophobic agendas, specifically under Ronald Reagan’s administration. Miller assumes a voice of political agency through his involvement with ACT UP Los Angeles and critiques the medical industrial complex for contributing to the AIDS death toll. He concludes by envisioning a queer futurity beyond the stigma of HIV/AIDS where gay men are free to be themselves. Stretch Marks was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s “History of the Future” (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars, however, leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full by HIDVL in 2015.
=520  \\$aTim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's work explores the artistic, spiritual, and political topography of his identity as a gay man. His performances have been presented across the world in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, London Institute of Contemporary Art, Walker Art Center, Actors Theatre of Louisville, and Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller is the author of Shirts & Skin (1997), Body Blows (2002), and 1001 Beds (2006), and his solo performance works have been published in O Solo Homo (1998) and Sharing the Delirium (1994). He has taught performance at the University of California, Los Angeles, New York University, the School of Theology at Claremont University, and other universities across the United States. He is a co-founder of Performance Space 122 in New York City and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, California. www.timmillerperformer.com

=518  \\$aRecorded in Atlanta, Georgia, August 1, 1992.
=520  \\$aIn this Lecture from 1992, part of the ATHE Conference, Augusto Boal talks about his journey as a director and the trajectory of the Theatre of the Oppressed. Boal discusses the different kind of oppression he encountered in Europe and how he came to develop the Rainbow of Desire technique - exercises based on the internalization of oppression, ‘the cop in the head.’ During this lecture Augusto Boal presents and discusses three drawings - ‘What is Theatre?’; ‘What is a Human Being?’; and ‘What is an Actor?’ - as a way to emphasize the Theatre of the Oppressed as a methodology of exercises, games, images, and techniques that restore human capacity to do, to be theatre.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed. Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled. His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed.
=520  \\$aThe Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems. The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.

=520  \\$aIn the midst of the US culture wars, Franklin Furnace, in collaboration with the Brooklyn Museum, presented “Too Shocking To Show.” The event was prompted by the National Endowment for the Arts’ revocation of Franklin Furnace’s Visual Artists Organizations grant and the heightened institutional censorship of sexually explicit art. Throughout the performance, speakers discuss the systemic effects of censorship by the NEA, alongside artists that have either been censored by the NEA or considered obscene by conservative and religious groups. It examines how the NEA impacts the inclusion of sexual imagery and political subject matter in the arts. Featured speakers and artists in this video include Robert T. Buck, Martha Wilson, Carol S. Vance, Sapphire, Holly Hughes, Scarlet O, and Tim Miller.
=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize, and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms, as well as to undertake other activities related to these purposes.

=520  \\$aThis video documentation shows a selection of Astrid Hadad and Los Tarzanes’ songs. In ‘Heavy Nopal,’ Astrid uses Mexican iconic references, like the cactus, the rock, the pyramid, and the tequila bottle. These elements are not just scenery, but they appear also on Hadad’s own body, which so becomes a human, mobile stage, and also an altar. From the calla lilies to the extremely complex surprise-multi-purpose outfits, to the innumerable ornaments, ‘rebozos,’ virgins of Guadalupe, guns, and common places in the essence of Mexico, Astrid Hadad and her Tarzanes transport the audience through several levels of iconography. Through this iconography, Hadad offers different meanings for both the female body and the Mexican political body.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=518  \\$aPerformed at the Highways Performance Space, Santa Monica, CA, USA, in 1993.
=520  \\$aAnnie Sprinkle is a prostitute/porn star turned artist/sexologist. She explores sexuality through her unique brand of feminist sex films, writings, artworks, performances, and teachings. Sprinkle has long championed sex worker rights and health care, and was pivotal in the Sex Positive Feminist Movement of the 1980's. She received her BFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City and was the first porn star to earn a Ph.D, which was awarded to her by the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco. For many years, Sprinkle has collaborated with her long time partner, Elizabeth Stephens, an artist and UCSC professor. Sprinkle and Stephens are active leaders of the Ecosex Movement, where they are committed to making environmental activism more sexy, fun, and diverse through artistic gestures. www.anniesprinkle.org / www.sexecology.org
=520  \\$aPost Porn Modernist chronicles Annie Sprinkle's careers as a sex worker, pro-sex activist, and artist. Sprinkle begins with her transformation from Ellen Steinberg to Annie Sprinkle, an act that prompted her sexual revolution. In this process of becoming, Sprinkle critiques patriarchal ideals of female sexuality and second-wave feminist anti-porn agendas. While critical of the male gaze, Sprinkle engages the gesture by posing on her own terms and affirming her sexual pleasure to re-appropriate the gaze throughout the performance. She provides a playful critique of the National Endowment for the Arts, alluding to her exhibit Carnival Knowledge (1984) presented by Franklin Furnace, which was reprimanded by the federal agency for its feminist pornographic content. Sprinkle discusses the labor politics of the sex work industry and her close relationships to clients, some of whom were disabled, lesbian, transgender, or gay men with HIV/AIDS. During the AIDS epidemic, Sprinkle focused her sex work on developing new practices such as the breath orgasm, a technique created with Barbara Carrellas, which allowed those infected with the disease to experience pleasure without having intercourse. This shift in Sprinkle’s work prompted the transformation of Annie into Anya, a persona who embodies the sacred energy of ancient goddess prostitutes. Post Porn Modernist was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015.

=518  \\$aVideotaped in Vienna, Austria on 6/3/1994.
=520  \\$aThe Politisches Theatre lecture Boal gave in 1994 in Vienna, Austria, narrates the trajectory of the Theater of the Oppressed and several key moments in its trajectory. Beginning with the socio-political history of Brazil in the 1960s, Boal marks the military dictatorship, discriminatory land laws, police abuse, drug trade in the slums, and migration as inspiring him to develop this method of theater. One of the early works called 'The Peasants' Story' was an important turning point for the Theater of the Oppressed, because it taught Boal and his fellow actors not to create plays that demanded actions and risks they themselves were not ready to take, 'I am never again going to do plays to incite people to do things I am not ready to do.' From here, with Forum Theater Boal began to encourage others to join to express themselves and create theater works, such as 'The Naked People Scene.' In this way, people understood their problems to be political and themselves as active participants in opposing their oppression.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal was an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination.

=520  \\$aA rare interview with Bob Flanagan and Sheree Rose conducted by Franklin Furnace Founding Director Martha Wilson and her partner, Vince Bruns. Set in the exhibit Visiting Hours: An Installation by Bob Flanagan in collaboration with Sheree Rose at the New Museum, the interview details the duo’s performance art practice. Throughout, Flanagan and Rose discuss the sexual politics of art; pain as an art medium; the gaze of receiving and witnessing pain; art as an erotic gesture; and the spiritual in art. These topics are further discussed in the larger context of performance art history, referencing the erotic work of Ron Athey and Annie Sprinkle in relationship to Flanagan’s performances with Rose.
=520  \\$aBob Flanagan and Sheree Rose began their artistic collaboration in the late 1980’s Los Angeles club and art scenes. Their performance, photography, and video work integrates elements of BDSM, which culminated in the exhibit ‘Visiting Hours’ at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and at the New Museum. After Flanagan’s death to cystic fibrosis in 1996, Rose continued to make artwork honoring Flanagan’s legacy and their collaboration. Rose made contributions to the documentary, ‘Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist,’ which premiered at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded a Special Jury Prize. She was commissioned by Japan to produce ‘Boballoon,’ a 20-foot inflatable statue of Flanagan that was exhibited at Big Space in Tokyo. Rose shows her photography at international galleries, including the Coagula in Los Angeles, Tate Modern in Liverpool, and Jeu de Paume in Paris, and has presented multiple performances at Highways Performance Space and Gallery in Santa Monica. Long after Flanagan’s death, his artwork with Rose continues to be a model for artists dealing with illness and death.

=518  \\$aPerformed at the Highways Performance Space, Santa Monica, CA, in 1994.
=520  \\$aTim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's creative work as a performer and writer explores the artistic, spiritual and political topography of his identity as a gay man. Miller's performances have been presented all over North America, Australia, and Europe in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, the Institute of Contemporary Art (London), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller’s most recent book 1001 BEDS, an anthology of his performances, essays and journals, was published by University of Wisconsin Press in 2006. Miller has taught performance at UCLA, NYU, the School of Theology at Claremont and at universities all over the US. He is a co-founder of two of the most influential performance spaces in the United States: Performance Space 122 on Manhattan's Lower East Side and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, CA. After a nine-year stint in New York City, in 1987 Miller returned home to Los Angeles, California where he was born and raised. He currently lives there with his partner Alistair in Venice Beach.
=520  \\$aThe sound and physicality of breath comes to the forefront when sexual climax, life, and death intertwine. Presenting vignettes of life, love, suffering, and humor, Tim Miller offers a compelling storytelling about his own life in NYC in the 80s, signaling breathing as life assurance in a moment when the AIDS epidemic and the work with ACT UP dwelled in-between survival and disappearance. This solo piece emerged from Miller's aesthetic ambition to mirror gay society's cultural conflicts while ‘trying to find an artistic, spiritual and political response to the AIDS crisis.’ ‘Do it like your life depends on it,’ Miller declares, breathing rhythmically and deeply, ‘which it does. In and out. Breathe. Breathe out the lie that we don't belong together. Breathe in the love. Run naked through the streets of L.A. Proclaim the end of sadness. Celebrate the miracle of us.’ Song and water make the body vulnerable and strong at the same time, in connection with all those that might be dead but not really gone.

=520  \\$aRon Athey’s Four Scenes in a Harsh Life (1994) confronts the sexual politics of religiosity. Expressed through ritualistic acts, Athey and his fellow performers, Divinity P. Fudge, Julie Tolentino, and Pig Pen, use the body as a site to queer religious iconography and to reconstitute a politic that affirms the queer body amid the AIDS crisis and culture wars in the United States. Heightened by national homophobia and conservative agendas, Athey, who is HIV-positive, was falsely accused by the Minneapolis Star and other media outlets for exposing the audience to AIDS-tainted blood, when in fact the blood central to the performance was from performer Divinity P. Fudge, who is HIV-negative. The polemic of blood in the performance ignited discrimination and censorship of Athey’s work across art venues and by the National Endowment for the Arts. Athey was also attacked by the religious right for employing a queer lens to examine religion, gender, and sexuality. Through the performance, Athey and company manifest a stigmata of the queer body that sparked national debates on censoring and exhibiting sexually explicit art. Following the mass censorship of Athey’s work in the the art world, video documentation of Four Scenes in a Harsh Life was broadcast online as part of Franklin Furnace’s “History of the Future” (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com) [link now (2018) defunct].
=520  \\$aRon Athey is a London-based performance artist from Los Angeles. He has performed body and sound-based works since 1981, debuting with Premature Ejaculation (PE), a collaboration with Rozz Williams. In the height of the AIDS pandemic, Ron Athey and Company toured “The Torture Trilogy” (1992-1995) at art venues across the world. Athey began his solo career with “Solar Anus” (1998) and later with “Self Obliteration” (2007-2012), while simultaneously developing “Incorruptible Flesh” (1997-2008). He has collaborated with Lawrence Steger on “Incorruptible Flesh (In Progress)” (1996), Juliana Snapper on “The Judas Cradle” (2004), and Julie Tolentino on company works throughout the 90s and “The Sky Remains the Same” (2008-).

=518  \\$aRecorded at the Franklin Furnace, New York, NY, USA, on April 28, 1995.
=520  \\$aFranklin Furnace Founding Director Martha Wilson discusses the political landscape of the arts organization in the context of the avant-garde and the culture wars in the United States. Wilson situates performance art as a confrontational form that emerged from Futurism, Constructivism, and Dadaism in the early 20th century. She describes the radical nature of performance art as a medium that transmits conceptual thinking through live actions, as evidenced by the work of Franklin Furnace artists Karen Finley, Annie Sprinkle, and Scarlet O. Wilson explains how the political subject matter embodied by these artists—feminism, pornography, and sexuality—impacted Franklin Furnace as an arts organization in the conservative climate of the culture wars. She notes the consistent attacks by religious right groups on Franklin Furnace that led to defunding from the National Endowment for the Arts, as the organization was accused of presenting obscene art with government funds. Despite the upheaval, Wilson, in true avant-garde fashion, insisted that ‘Until they cart me away in a straightjacket, I am going to continue to present performance art.’ While an advocate for government funding, Wilson is critical of the regulation of content in the arts—a phenomenon that did not manifest in other sectors of public funding at the time.
=520  \\$aMartha Wilson is a pioneering gallery director and feminist artist who creates innovative photographic and video works that explore her female subjectivity. Wilson founded Franklin Furnace in 1976, an artist-run space that champions the exploration, promotion, and preservation of artist books, temporary installation, performance art, as well as online works. She has been described by New York Times critic Holland Cotter as one of ‘the half-dozen most important people for art in downtown Manhattan in the 1970s.’ Wilson has received fellowships for performance art from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts; Bessie and Obie awards for commitment to artists’ freedom of expression; a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts; a Richard Massey Foundation-White Box Arts and Humanities Award; and an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University. www.marthawilson.com

=520  \\$aCo-Madres (co-founders) talk about the creation of Latina Theatre Lab and the creative process of producing original work with 'El Amanecer' host, Isabel Lucero. An excerpt of 'The Miracle,' from The Immaculate Conception, is part of this video. Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San Francisco Bay Area actresses known as the 'comadres': Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also have collaborated with fellow comedy troupes in California, such as Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Miss Puerto Rico o La isla que se repite,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez as a part of ‘A alboroto limpio,’ a project organized and directed by Nelson Rivera, which also included dance pieces by Oscar Mestey and Awilda Sterling. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation. ‘Miss Puerto Rico o la isla que se repite’ is a contemporary experimental dance and performance that dialogues with the cultural climate in Puerto Rico. Vázquez reflects upon the figure of Miss Puerto Rico performing in bath clothes and a ‘crown’ with the shape of the island. The logic of beauty contests is questioned by the contrast between ‘graceful’ movements and a struggling body, which is a tool and an obstacle at the same time. The political implications of this dance performance suggest a major role of the citizens in Puerto Rico’s sovereignty: how is ‘the island,’ as a geographical body, related to the physical body, and the political body?

=520  \\$aThe performance ‘Contraelviento’ (Against the Wind) was created by Peru’s leading theatre collective Yuyachkani in 1989, at the height of the country’s most recent civil conflict. It recounts the testimony of an indigenous survivor of the 1986 massacre at Soccos, in Ayacucho. Coya and her sister, Huaco, along with their father, are in the midst of colliding forces that destroy everything in the peasant village in the middle of the Andes where they live. The scenes of devastation correspond to the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Army that left civilians with no options for survival. The symbolic seeds of life would represent an option to preserve life, at the expense of the death of the peasants. Masked dancers and archangels fight for ownership of the peasants’ souls in the ‘danza de la diablada’ or Devil dance from the Fiesta de la Candelaria in Puno. After their death, the seeds of life are left by the peasants in the ground, and into the hands of the Ekeko, a constant figure on stage, who performs as witness of the story, and who will transmit both the seeds of life and the narration: ‘these seeds were given to me by a woman, who told me a story.’ The music, images, and voices bring Peruvian traditions to the stage, and at the same time reveal the miscommunications between those who hold power to exert either violence or justice, and the peasants who demand to be taking into account. The difficulties that they have to confront also encompass their constant efforts for survival – as Ekeko affirms: ‘the condor learnt to fly against the wind; now you have to follow him.’
=520  \\$aPeru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

=520  \\$aIn ‘Looking In/To The Future,’ the New WORLD Theater worked with young people in the Khmer, Vietnamese, Latina/o, and African-American communities surrounding Amherst, Massachusetts to help them define their cultural identities through writing and theatre activities. In this workshop final presentation, a group of young performers discuss their social, cultural, and class backgrounds. Speaking in their many languages, we get a glimpse into the characters’ lives in a school setting, expressing their parents’ expectations for their future, and their cultural legacy of the past. They also engage with games, and while performing their ‘animal personalities,’ they reflect upon their land, nature, and village. By the end of the play, the young performers come out on stage and collectively state the message ‘Were going to a place where we can make a new world.’ This video documentation features a brief Q&A with the performers.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

The aftermath of the devil's death is a beautiful day in which a series of rights are honored and enjoyed - land, health, education, work, housing, etc.

=518  \\$aPerformed at the New Conservatory Theatre, San Francisco, CA, USA, in September 1999.
=520  \\$aHolly Hughes investigates the politics of art and democracy in Preaching to the Perverted. She discusses her recent appearance before the U.S.Supreme Court in the case NEA v. Finley (1998). Hughes, along with Karen Finley, John Fleck, and Tim Miller, were awarded grants by the National Endowment for the Arts that were later revoked for obscenity. The group of artists, which became known as the NEA Four, filed a case against the National Endowment for the Arts asserting First Amendment and statutory claims. Hughes reenacts scenes from the U.S. Supreme Court trial that she calls ‘theatrical spectacles,’ while noting the larger context of censorship in the arts in the United States. She de-centers national debates surrounding freedom, citizenship, and democracy from a lesbian feminist point of view and asserts her artistic freedom by creating performances that reflect a radical body politic. Hughes’ testimony, alongside those of Finley, Fleck, and Miller, led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in favor of the NEA Four’s case against the National Endowment for the Arts. She further elaborates upon the NEA Four trial and the conservative political climate of the nation during the case in the Q&A session following the performance. Preaching to the Perverted was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015.
=520  \\$aHolly Hughes is a writer and performer, who began her thespian adventures at the WOW Cafe Theater in the Lower East Side of New York City. Her work deals with questions of identity and sexual desire, drawing recognition including two Village Obie Awards, a Guggenheim Fellowship, funding from Creative Capital, NYSCA, and the NEA, as well as the ire of the religious right during the culture wars. Hughes’s books include Clit Notes: A Sapphic Sampler (1996), O Solo Homo: The New Queer Performance (1998), Animal Acts: Performing Species Today (2014), and Memories of the Revolution: Ten Years of the WOW Cafe (forthcoming). She is a Professor at the University of Michigan where she founded the BFA in Interarts Performance.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez discusses the possibility of developing a non-Western, Mesoamerican acting technique, based in a pre-Hispanic conception of the human being, which understands the body in a conjunction of mind and spirit. Jesusa Rodríguez follows Alfredo Federico López Austin’s research on the Aztec worldview and on Mesoamerican religion, and explains how she concentrates her strength in bodily channeling the persons she characterizes in her shows. In the second part of this interview, she channels La Malinche, the interpreter and lover of Hernán Cortés in Mexico’s Conquest, to tell her true story. Through this example, and in a dialogue with contemporary indigenous communities’ struggles, Jesusa Rodríguez proposes alternative ways of knowledge, and alternative art and performance techniques, based on indigenous worldviews.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

=520  \\$aIn Secret Identities, the Guerrilla Girls discuss the exclusion of women artists, writers, and performers in art history. Concealed behind gorilla masks, the Guerrilla Girls take on the names of dead women artists - Claude Cahun, Julia de Burgos, Audre Lorde, and Ana Mendieta, among others - as a feminist gesture to counter the erasure of their work by cultural and artistic institutions. Furthermore, the video includes footage of Guerrilla Girls street actions targeting museums and galleries that fail to include women artists in their exhibitions and collections. Several women artists are listed at the end of Secret Identities as a political act to re-inscribe their names into art history, which has otherwise failed to include or recognize such contributions to art practice and discourse.
=520  \\$aThe Guerilla Girls are an anonymous women's collective that take on the names of dead women artists as pseudonyms for interventions. Concealed behind gorilla masks in action, the Guerilla Girls use various tactics to intervene in art, culture, and politics. Through the production of printed materials, publications, and performance actions, the Guerilla Girls expose political matters, convey information, and provoke discussions in public contexts. Notorious for exposing the exclusion of women artists, the Guerilla Girls have staged interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Venice Biennale, the Centre Pompidou, among other renowned venues. The Guerilla Girls work is presented from feminist and humorist perspectives. www.guerrillagirls.com

=518  \\$aRecorded at the Martin Luther King Center, New York, USA, Oct. 7, 2000.
=520  \\$aIn this Lecture at the Martin Luther King Center in 2000, Augusto Boal gives an overview of the trajectory of the Theatre of the Oppressed techniques from ‘Newspaper Theatre’ to the ‘Rainbow of Desire’. During this lecture, Boal also gives some hands-on activities leading a few Forum Theatre exercises and several general exercises that can be found in his book Theatre of the Oppressed: Games for Actors and Non-Actors.
=520  \\$aAugusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed. Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled. His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed.
=520  \\$aThe Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems. The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.

=520  \\$a‘Vivir muriendo’ is a cabaret-format show, where Astrid Hadad performs a direct political satire against the aftermath of Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo’s Mexican government. Hadad’s iconic and continuously morphing clothes are an allegory of Mexican nation, condensed in her body and her powerful voice. Playing in the intertwining relationship between politics and sexuality, ‘Vivir muriendo’ is a thermometer of the Mexican political situation at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. Her work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy Nopal.’ The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=520  \\$aIn this video documentation, Astrid Hadad develops a musical arrangement regarding violence against women. Although her songs come from Mexican tradition and clearly refer to Mexican women, Hadad’s comments during the show suggests that gendered violence is endemic, and that is suffered not only by Latin American women, but by women all around the world. Dressed as ‘Adelita,’ iconic female figure of the Mexican Revolution, Hadad claims a stronger position for women in society. Female sexuality is at the center of her songs, looking for a liberation of women’s bodies – playing with Emiliano Zapata’s words, she says that ‘the orgasm belongs to those who work for it.’

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world' - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers' dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aIn 'Umoja,' young members from Project 2050 perform monologues exploring social issues ranging from immigration to women’s liberation. The use of different languages bring together their roots and their future, placing them in-between tradition and futurity. Diverse stories travel from individualities to the history of entire communities: One young performer reflects on her experience as a Vietnamese immigrant pursuing the 'American Dream.' Another young performer discusses his inter-racial identity from a Colombian perspective. Another young performer states her views about feminism from a 'dark girl's perspective.' Among all these different struggles and dreams, there are points of contact and similarities that set the ground for a better future. Thus, the performance ends with the performers collectively dancing and chanting harmoniously in their diversity.

=520  \\$aIn 2000, New York City’s SummerStage hosted a unique concert where three powerful women offered the best of their repertoire. Astrid Hadad, Liliana Felipe, and Eugenia León performed both individually and together, in a show organized and directed by Jesusa Rodríguez. The presence of these women in Central Park, singing in Spanish, speaks about the intertwined relationship between the local and the transnational, as well as the interest in Latin American and Latino/a culture in New York City. The political strength of this performance comes from the voices, the bodies, and the words of these amazing women. This video documentation includes mostly Astrid Hadad’s participation in the show, as well as a grand finale where she and Liliana Felipe and Eugenia León delight the audience with smart and fun rancheras.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City's Centro Universitario de Teatro. She looks to cabaret and performance to represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the same time, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global contexts. Eugenia León is a singer born in Mexico, defined as a singer committed to the people and their causes. She has performed all around the world and her repertoire includes diverse genres, such as tango, bolero, norteño, Latin American music and rancheras. The strength and versatility of her voice makes her one of the most beloved and recognized Mexican singers. Liliana Felipe is a composer, singer, actor, tango musician, and clergyphobe. She left Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in 1976, but her sister and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000 disappeared. She and her partner, Jesusa Rodríguez, owned and operated El Habito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. Jesusa Rodríguez is a Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur and social activist, who has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects.

=520  \\$aFrom September 26-29, 2000 on the campus of the University of Massachusetts, New WORLD Theater convened a major national and international gathering, ‘Intersection II,’ a conference/performance festival focused on interdisciplinary and intercultural theater work. ‘Intersection II’ included international participation, while examining innovative theater practice within community, and national and global spheres. The event brought together artists, intellectuals, theater producers, arts presenters, and arts activists to explore the process, evolution, and dynamics of making theater in the dawning moments of the 21st century. One of the featured performances was ‘Antígona,’ directed by Miguel Rubio Zapata and masterfully performed by Teresa Ralli, founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (Peru). This one-woman performance of José Watanabe’s version of Sophocles classic tragedy is a breathtaking example of the devastation caused by twenty years of civil violence in Peru. Although this is the story of only one character, it speaks for the nearly 70,000 disappeared men, women and children of Peru, and for the thousands of survivors who are still fighting for their right to mourn their loved ones.
=520  \\$aPeru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth.

=520  \\$aIn 'Time Capsule,' youth performers explore social-political issues that directly affect their lives. Difference in opportunities based on class, spread violence, the AIDS pandemic, racism, amongst other social and political issues, are embodied on stage and transmitted as concrete realities. The performers intertwine these issues to their own lives through narrative, gesture and song, building little pieces of a social fabric – and addressing a society where they are looking for their own place. From this very personal point of view, they critically evaluate how the world is in the present, and what they expect, fear, and hope for the future.

This video documentation of the inauguration and welcoming of ‘Intersection II’ shows how the event bridged the worlds of creativity and scholarship, community activism and professional performance. Roberta Uno discusses the social politics of New WORLD Theater in the same space where Mildred Ruiz enacts this vision and mission through her songs.

=520  \\$aUniverses performs a piece at the Andy Warhol Museum as part of Off the Wall, a contemporary performance series held at the museum. A different setting from a theater, the museum space invites a more intimate performance, with minimal stage design, and bare white lighting. The ensemble performs excerpts of work-in-progress pieces, particularly ‘Slanguage,’ a comment on the issues of poverty, family, drugs, racism, and street violence, yet finding hope in the contemporary urban landscape, and believing in the power of language to create social change through collective words, stories, and narratives.
=520  \\$aUniverses is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.

=518  \\$aPerformed in Monterrey, Mexico on June 18, 2001, as part of the Second Annual Hemispheric Institute Seminar entitled Memory, Atrocity and Resistance.
=520  \\$aStarting with a semiotic performative that states ‘this is not a performance,’ this lecture/performance is another turn of the screw of René Magritte’s ‘this is not a pipe’ and Fernando Muñoz’ ‘this is not a cow.’ The relationship between performance and art tradition intertwines with a constant interpellation of the audience, blurring the boundaries between art and life. In the Q&A, Maris Bustamante renders her understanding of what non-objective arts are, and how gender roles can perform in art. A juicy conversation about her trajectory includes insights about gender and sexuality, feminist art, maternity, and her work with Polvo de gallina negra and No-Grupo.
=520  \\$aMaris Bustamante is neo trans post conceptualist strident visual producer. Since her first happening in 1971, Maris Bustamante (1949, Mexico) - a graduate from the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda at Mexico City - began ‘a search for non-traditional support’ or what she called ‘non-objective art.’ In 1977, along with other artists, she started a movement of ‘savage vanguard’ called ‘No-Grupo.’ With No-Grupo Bustamante created humored and caustic performances where gender was a major source material. In 1983, Bustamante and Mónica Mayer founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder) - a name based in the popular belief that black hen’s powder is a protection against evil eye or, in this case, attacks against feminism.

=520  \\$aIn this video documentation of Astrid Hadad 's performance 'Amores Pelos', costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global contexts.
=520  \\$aAstrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. Her work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy Nopal.’ The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance. Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings. Through her voice and her body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

=520  \\$aMarlène Ramírez-Cancio and Claire Crosby interview Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, who talk about their beginnings both as artists and as a couple. They conceived their wedding as a performative act, which was a symbolic statement against a law in Mexico called “Sociedad en Convivencia” (living together in society). Their wedding was immediately followed by their divorce as a part of a contract that should make the couple’s life easier. As they do not believe in marriage or in a social legalization of affect, Jesusa and Liliana talk about how institutions impose and shape issues as sexuality, gender, and human rights. These two wonderful women speak about how society understands masculine and feminine; they also discuss how their art practice and cabaret performances question women's oppression and inequality of power, and how cabaret can function as a thermometer for political struggles. For them, revolution starts from within ourselves, and then it could expand to transform our world. Jesusa and Liliana ran together the famous El Hábito in Mexico City, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action. Liliana Felipe is a composer, singer, gardener, tango musician, and clergyphobe. She left Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in 1976, but her sister and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000 disappeared.

=520  \\$aThis video features documentation of an interview with Alina Troyano/Carmelita Tropicana at the Second Hemispheric Institute Encuentro, "Memory, Atrocity and Resistance", in Monterrey, Mexico from June 14-23, 2001. With a great dose of humor, Carmelita begins the interview by giving a brief introduction of herself and her relationship with the Hemispheric Institute Encuentro. She discusses her roots in Havana, Cuba and her experiences of migrating to the United States. She also remembers the legendary night of performance surrounding identity politics at New Museum, The Studio Museum, and The Museum of Hispanic Arts (performers included Guillermo Gomez-Peña, David Wojnarowicz, and James Luna amongst others). It was this evening of performance as part of ‘The Decade Show: Frameworks of Identity in the 1980s’ that changed Carmelita's writing into a different personal tone and multi-dimensional style, referencing ‘Milk of Amnesia’ at PS122 as an example of such writing.
=520  \\$aAlina Troyano (a.k.a.Carmelita Tropicana) is a Cuban-born performance artist, playwright, and actor who has presented work internationally, from el Museo del Barrio in NYC to Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. Her book, ‘I, Carmelita Tropicana: Performing Between Cultures’ includes plays, monologues, performance art pieces, and short stories. In Tropicana’s work humor and fantasy become subversive tools to rewrite history. Tropicana’s performances plays and videos have been presented at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, Hebbel Am Ufer in Berlin, Centre de Cultura Contemporanea in Barcelona, the Berlin International Film Festival, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, the Mark Taper Forum’s Kirk Douglas Theater in Los Angeles, and El Museo del Barrio in New York. She has received numerous awards including the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman and fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts as well as an Obie for Sustained Excellence in Performance.

=518  \\$aPerformed in the Bowker Auditorium at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2001.
=520  \\$a‘I Was Born With 2 Tongues’ was created by the New WORLD Theater Residency, which brought young performers to explore their own artistic voice. In this rehearsal of a slam/spoken word performance, a group of talented young artists discusses the politics of trying to get roles as different body-typed people, and how racial identities might be a challenge. Moreover, their voices made us reflect upon the misogyny women face on a daily basis; family and cultural identity; immigration, race, and nationhood. Although all of them are difficult topics, the power of these voices, and the energy of the performers, offer a glimpse of hope. This video documentation features ‘In America’ by Dennis; ‘Letter to Our Unborn Children’ by Ensemble; ‘Not your Fetish’ by Emily and Anida; ‘Race and I’m Running’ by Dennis and Marlon;‘Morning Papers’ by Marlon; ‘Excuse Me America’ by Anida; ‘Lost and Found’ by Dennis; and ‘Loudmouth Woman’ by Emily.
=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’ - one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with people of the future - youth, in equal collaboration with artists and scholars.

=520  \\$aFrom 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a 'new world'-one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 'outpost' in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater's artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers' dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.
=520  \\$aThis video documentation features Project 2050, giving a detailed explanation of this initiative's goals. Roberta Uno, founder and artistic director of New WORLD Theater briefly describes the reach of the project, and explains the metaphor - and demographic projection - that in year 2050 people of color will out number white people. The video presents teachers from the program, discussing the future of art, race, and aesthetics. Also, the video showcases artistic works created by youth artists involved with Project 2050. In the summer of 2001, these pieces explored identity politics, immigration, incarceration, exploitation, negotiation, and identification as main topics addressed through artistic and activist work. Young performers and their mentors interpellate industrial projects and community survival, discrimination, solidarity, and heritage narratives. The vitality of the youth art program is felt through student testimonials and it is further related to the necessity to make such program accessible in public schools. As it is highlighted in the credits, all students, artists and scholars, counselors, and staff involved in the project worked together to reach 'year 2001 and counting….'

=520  \\$aProject 2050 youth theatre artists presented a series of short works throughout the program. Composed like vignettes, these youth performers present pieces about race, class, immigration, identity politics, and social issues. The youth theatre artists use an array of movement, beatboxing, spoken word, and song, to convey their individual and collective narratives. Racism, prisons, and nationalism are other themes explored in their works. The group works in-between collective struggles and individual stories about themselves. They bring to the stage the same configurations, conflicts, alliances, and acts of solidarity that populate our world. This inspiring evening of short works ends with a hip-hop and breakdance jam session with all youth theatre artists present on stage.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesús Martín Barbero, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aJesús Martín Barbero is a semiologist, anthropologist, philosopher, and specialist in communication and media who has produced important theoretical work on the topic of postmodernity in Latin America. His contributions include his analysis of culture as a web of mediations, the semiological study of globalization, the alienating function of the local media, and the function of telenovelas in Latin America. He has been the president of the ALAIC (Asociación Latinoamericana de Investigadores de la Comunicación- Latin American Association of Communications Researchers) and a member of the Advisory Committee of the FELAFACS (Federación Latinoamericana de Facultades de Comunicación Social- Latin American Federation of Schools for Social Communication). He is a member of the Comité Científico de Infoamérica (Scientific Committee of Infoamérica).

The clips feature pieces of performances by Project 2050, Everett Dance Theatre, Rennie Harris Puremovement, and UNIVERSES. Project 2050’s ‘Ashy Ankles’ explores oppressive statements around race and gender that the performers have experienced as young women of color. Everette Dance Theatre’s piece interweaves spoken dialogue and movement, thus underlining the meaningful roles of voice and body in performance. Rennie Harris Puremovement explores gender and race violence, and the struggles tied to identity politics. Finally, UNIVERSES performs a song that invites to reflect upon race and ethnicity as both a mark of identity and an impulse to create a better future.

=520  \\$aVideo documentation of ‘La Bruja Monja’ (‘The Demon’s Nun’), followed by Q&A, performed during the 4th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2003 in New York, United States, under the title ‘Spectacles of Religiosities.’ ‘The Demon’s Nun’ is a piece by two Mayan playwrights, Petrona de la Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinoza, who are also founder and current members of FOMMA, a women’s collective in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas. The protagonist is a woman named Domitila whose husband, a drinker and a lecher, complains that she never wants to have sex; instead, she directs her erotic longings toward the divine: a luminous angel who appears in her dreams, and the santitos or small statues of saints to whom she prays. The Demon’s Nun offers a humorous view of very serious issues—violence against women, limited educational opportunities, alcoholism, and abuse by priests.
=520  \\$aPetrona de la Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinosa are Mayan Indian playwrights and actresses from Chiapas, Mexico. Pioneers in theatre and social justice in their country, in 1994 they formed the women’s cooperative FOMMA, to empower displaced Indian women and children through workshops in bilingual education (Tzotzil/Tzeltal and Spanish) health programs, job skills and theatre. They have performed in small communities throughout Chiapas as well as at universities and festivals abroad. Forced to leave their native villages at an early age, they became maids in the neighboring mestizo city of San Cristóbal de las Casas. In the 1980s they went to work at the fledging Indian writers' cooperative, Sna Jtz'bajom. It was there they became interested in theatre and received training from Ralph Lee of the Metawee River Theatre Company. They have subsequently worked with several other teachers including Amy Trompetter and Luis de Tavira.

With the slain rapper as his guide, Wally is witness to the revelations of Tupac in the afterlife. Among regrets of lost love and falling prey to life in the street, Wally learns valuable lessons about life and what you take with you far beyond the grave. Giving Up the Gun is a poignant examination of life, death, and what comes after.

=520  \\$aNayra is collective creation of La Candelaria that explores the unconscious and the popular worldview about health, death, and displacement. 'Nayra' is an Aymara word that means 'eye,' but can also mean 'ancestors,' 'memory' and 'vision.' Director Santiago García describes the piece as 'an exploration of our myths and legends as both Colombians and Latin Americans.' This piece enacts a time/space of assemblages that address the quest for connections more than the connections per se. By the end of the piece, mirrors blow to pieces, thus recalling not only a fragmented shared memory, but also a country crushed by violence.
=520  \\$aLa Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.

=520  \\$aA tale of teachers, artists, and activists, Danny Hoch’s Till the Break of Dawn takes place in the Havana of 2001. Chronicling the meetings and mishaps that happen at a Cuban hip-hop festival, the New Yorkers are confronted by numerous struggling Cubans, an exiled Black Panther, and youth from the global hip-hop scene. It is in this changing landscape where they must confront their changing ideas and commitments to activism, and to each other. Culminating with the events of September 11th, Till the Break of Dawn is a critical look at the cultures of American imperialism, idealism, and hip-hop that affects each of the characters.
=520  \\$aThis work is written and directed by acclaimed actor, poet, and playwright Danny Hoch. A two-time DEF poet, a Senior Fellow at the New School’s Vera List Center for Arts & Politics among numerous other awards and accolades, Hoch is the founder of the Hip Hop Theater Festival.

=520  \\$aA head-on confrontation of issues such as school shootings, child abuse, and more, The Suicide Kings’ In Spite of Everything is a seminal work in both spoken word performance and activist art. Featuring one of the fiercest Bay Area hip-hop collectives, under the direction of GOLDIE award-winning, Bay Area legend Marc Bamuthi Joseph, the story weaves through the days following the tragic event and the lives of both the perpetrators and victims to reveal the underlying issues, both institutional and personal, that lead to bullying and youth violence in schools. Opening with a group of writing workshop leaders at the head of a classroom, the fun is quickly stilled as the scene shifts to a police interrogation of one of the instructors about the biggest school shooting since Columbine. What happens next is as riveting as it is heartbreaking. The artists take the audience on a critical journey through fear-inducing journalism, violent video games, and more to reveal that violence and shootings in school cannot only be blamed on the perpetrator.

=520  \\$a‘The Fury of the Gods’ is an exercise in Pop Blasphemy, and an ecclesiastical experiment in Heathenism. It is a sharp biting satire that skewers the sacred and eviscerated evangelical fundamentalism suggesting that it may be the principal obstacle that stands in the way to intercultural understanding, creating a rhetoric of the state in order to justify segregation and oppression. Written and performed by Susana Cook, ‘The Fury of the Gods’ is a series of ecclesiastical interventions that mocks capitalist individualism with a humoristic self-criticism, playing with the idea that evangelical fundamentalism might have mistaken where ‘heaven’ can be found. Susana Cook uses religious oratory to highlight conservative interpretations of homosexuality and exaggerate them, taking them to their logical extremes. As conservative narrative appropriates religion to fulfill an agenda, Cook's work appropriates religious and political language as a means to unveil the ways that fundamentalist belief have come to influence public policy and unmask the real substance and immorality of these national messages.
=520  \\$aSusana Cook is a New York based Argentine playwright, performer, and director. She has presented her work as an independent artist for over 20 years.

=518  \\$aPerformed in the Bronx, NY, on July 27, 2008.
=520  \\$aThis video documentation features a performance that takes place after the artist leaves a seven-day retreat into a monastery where he devoted himself to the nocturnal adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament, prayer, and refrained from verbal language and communication with the outside world. Upon exiting the monastery he journeys on foot, along with invited friends and guests, to the Bronx Academy of Art and Dance where he breaks his vow of silence for a Question and Answer session. During the Q&A, the artist promises to only speak of nocturns once a year for seven consecutive years, 2008-2014 and to never speak of nocturns after the seventh year, thereby relying on the audience to spread information by word-of-mouth, and archiving the experience in a purely oral format.

=520  \\$aTeatro Jornalero Sin Fronteras /Day Laborers Theater Without Borders (TJSF) is a Los Angeles-based ensemble theater company comprised of day laborers. Founded in 2008 by Cornerstone Theater Company in conjunction with the National Day Labor Organizing Network, their mission is to improve the lives of day laborers by creating plays by and for the day labor community. Responding to an often degrading and hostile work environment and an increasingly anti-immigrant climate nationally, the troupe uses theater, music, and dialogue to educate and inform immigrant workers about their legal rights; to empower the community by reflecting their stories in their own voices; to humanize the immigration debate for the broader community; and to build a troupe of theater artists that make insightful, entertaining and smart theater for their audiences. Each year TJSF performs in over 50 locations for more than 3,000 day laborers, public school and college students, and diverse organizations, institutions, and agencies. They have received coverage in local, national and international media outlets, including La Opinion, LA Times, BBC World, Christian Science Monitor, and National Public Radio.
=520  \\$aIn ‘Salud’ (Health), people wait for their lab test results in a health clinic. One by one they are called by a doctor who informs them of different illness caused by sexually transmitted disease, toxic chemical contamination in blood and other organs, and malnutrition. These diagnoses revealed lack of sexual education, health education on chemicals and toxins, lack of proper equipment from their work, and most importantly, lack of food education – all of them key problems among immigrant and impoverished populations.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'El Dueño de las Mariposas' (‘Owner of the Butterflies’) tells the story of Chepe, an orphan predestined by his 'wayjel' - the hummingbird - to change the fate of the slaves suffering under the despotic regime of coffee plantation landowner Don Martín Contreras. The play exposes the despicable living and working conditions of the coffee workers, denouncing the violation of their human rights and demanding that the fundamental rights of these individuals be upheld. This piece is the result ofa process of collective creation on the relationship between politics and the body; the resulting performance brings together symbols, characters and circumstances from the rich Mayan imaginary as well as from the everyday life conditions of indigenous peoples in Latin America, in intricate labyrinths of time, love, injustice, and freedom, an urgent call for inalienable human rights.

=520  \\$aIn this introduction to the 30-years celebration of the first public CADA’s ‘acción,’ Diamela Eltit reads a text in which she highlights the political relevance of this collective in relationship with the Chilean dictatorship, and the hegemonic cultural domination against which CADA performed. CADA’s ‘acciones de arte’ functioned as an archive and artwork simultaneously. Their members wanted to make a strategic material from the excerpt; in this sense, their methodology is based on a fragmented reality, and heterogeneity. The well-known intervention ‘NO +’ was the opening to a rebel narrative, and also opened a space for the word from the streets, repressed by terror. In CADA, arts, politics, and poetics converge, and its legacy belongs to the city and the citizens. ‘NO +’ is now an artifact and grammar of the public domain.
=520  \\$aDiamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist and cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) during the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, and has been an important cultural presence during the years of the post-dictatorship through her participation in journals such as Revista de Crítica Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work has made important contributions to feminist theory and she has been a regular contributor to Debate Feminista. In 2000, she published ‘Emergencias: Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,’ a book of essays which brings together some of her literary and cultural criticism.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of Regina José Galindo’s artist talk ‘Experiences,’ presented in the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. Galindo offered a retrospective of her performance art work, from 1999 to the present, speaking about pieces of art that she links with vital experiences: ‘I have experiences with life’s episodes. I don’t know if these are sad or not. They are simply experiences, and these have shaped me. They have been the fountain of my wisdom, the fountain of what I can speak, of that I know.’ Galindo presents her body as a site of conflict and violence; the painful interventions on her own body are metaphors of different modes of class, gender, and political violence. Her experiences are a source of knowledge and memory, transformed into new images and actions - the basis of what she calls ‘art products.’
=520  \\$aRegina José Galindo was born in Guatemala City. Her work has been included in shows in diverse international venues, such as Venice-Istanbul, Museum of Modern Art, Istanbul; Into Me, Out of Me, P.S.1, New York, and Kunst-Werke Berlin; MASH, Miami; Las Fronteras del Género, Zaragoza, Spain; Estrecho Dudoso, Teorética, Costa Rica; MENS mankind, S.M.A.K., Belgium; Courants Alternatifs, PARVIS, Paris and Bordeaux, France; and Eretica, Palermo, Italy. She has been invited to participate in the Moscu Biennal 2007; I Bienal Arquitectura, Arte Paisaje Islas Canarias in 2006; III Biennale of Tirana, Albania in 2005; Venice Biennal in 2001 and 2005; II Biennal in Prague in 2005; and III Biennal in Lima, Peru in 2002. She won the Golden Lion Award for young artists for her participation in the Venice Biennal in 2005. Part of her work speaks about the history of socio-political violence in her native country of Guatemala; she also addresses economic and political contradictions and inequalities widespread in the Global South.

=520  \\$a‘Químicos’ (Chemicals) is a story in three parts. The first part recreates how day laborers are hired on the streets to do dangerous work, where they will use toxic chemicals and will not use proper equipment for protection. The second part describes the dangerous conditions in which day laborers work, and the difficulty they have in seeking professional health physicians when they are ill. The third part reflects upon the health of Hispanic/Latino communities, which are prone to different types of illness and diseases because of the types of food they consume - heavily greased, high in sugar and sodium. This type of nutrition leads to high numbers of Hispanic/Latino having diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. The ending of this piece is full of humor but reflexive, and advocates for a proper education and information about these situations to prevent illness and death.

=520  \\$a‘Demolición’ (Demolition) is a play about a group of day laborers hired to demolish a house that needs various repairs. Since these workers hardly speak any English to understand the address and instructions given to them, they search for someone who can translate. However, due to a miscommunication, they end up demolishing the wrong house. When the owners of the demolished house arrived, there is a succession of events both comic and tragic. Finally, the leader of the group, who made the contract, flees and leaves the rest of the day laborers behind without payment while shouting 'It was horrible, it was horrible comrades. You will get paid on the day of your judgment.' This piece reflects upon the injustices and lack of solidarity that immigrant laborers have to confront.

=520  \\$a‘Caminos al Paraíso’ (Paths to Paradise) is a story in three parts. It narrates all the adrenaline, fear, and insecurities experienced by immigrants when traveling from Mexico to the U.S.A. They are victims of the greed and violence from people who impose undignified and humiliating acts on them. These victimizers are different organized gangs; the ‘coyotes’ who take undocumented emigrants across the U.S.A. border; and the police who make millions off of illegal emigrants. Immigrants lose their dignities as human beings because they are treated like animals and violated by others along the way. Both women and men are abducted, raped, or murdered by criminals to extort their families who live in the United States – and when some immigrants fight for their human rights, they are killed. This piece is a cry for help and solidarity by the Mexicans living in the United States under unfair immigration policies, and a message about the harsh reality implied in the act of crossing borders.

=520  \\$a‘Bailando con La Migra’ (Dancing with Homeland Security) is a tragicomic, educative, and reflexive play about immigrants, whose luck can change from one minute to the next when searching for work, waiting for the bus, or taking their kids to school. Their lives are marked by the threat of being arrested by Homeland Security, the laws that poorly defend the immigrants, and the lack of proper knowledge of how to act in front of an official. An actor who plays the Forum Theater's Joker figure is introduced to interact with the audience as the play unfolds. At the end, there is hope that all undocumented immigrants and the agents of Homeland Security will come together and celebrate a better, united world. This educative play’s message for the audience is to go out and fight for immigration reform for all the 12 million undocumented people who live in the United States.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez talks about Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and her poem ‘Primero Sueño’ (‘First Dream’), a baroque work of art that condenses the genius of the 17th-century Mexican nun. She is linked through memory, history, and feminist statements with her contemporary counterpart, Jesusa Rodríguez, who memorized the almost 1,000 verses of the poem as a part of a creative process that allowed her not only to develop a profound interpretation of its contents, but also a fully bodily internalization experience. This intense relationship with the poem helped her to survive in the everyday world, to strengthen her political struggle, and to fight oblivion. For Jesusa Rodríguez, Sor Juana’s poetry is both a-temporal and contemporary, and a source of inspiration and wisdom to keep working on acts of resistance. As a tribute, Jesusa Rodríguez uses theater to transmit the greatest poem of one of the greatest Mexican poets, and to make it visible and accessible to everyone. Diverse stage elements serve as tools to reveal specific parts of the poem, through a ‘striptease,’ or an autopsy that helps to understand the beauty of Sor Juana’s words.
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

Sneed delivers scathing and raucously humorous commentary on some of the key issues of our time, taking her audience on a journey through popular culture, American politics, and the New York City underground scene of the '80s and '90s that insists on naming the unnamed and telling the untold.
=520  \\$aPamela Sneed is a New York-based poet, performer, writer and actress. She is the author of Imagine Being More Afraid of Freedom Than Slavery, published by Henry Holt (1998) and KONG and other works published by Vintage Entity Press (2009). She is the recipient of the 2006 BAX award for performance. Sneed has been featured in the New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, The Source, Time Out, VIBE, Karl Lagerfeld's ‘Off The Record,’ and on the cover of New York Magazine.

=520  \\$aFOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. ‘Buscando nuevos caminos’ (‘Looking for New Paths’) is a play about about the false promises that impulse indigenous men and women to find new opportunities in the United States. The forced separation due to migration leaves women by themselves, in a society where they have to learn to survive the violence and greed of unscrupulous relatives. When three young women decide to go to the North and cross the border to find their parents, they have to suffer the abuse of the ‘coyote’ and the difficult conditions of the desert. Trying to escape from the dangers in the border, families get separated, as many fractured families due to migration and violence. The women of FOMMA offer strong monologues about the desire of crossing the border – they measure the reasons to leave, but most importantly, the reasons to stay in Chiapas. They end the play with a firm ‘I’m going to live here, and I’m going to die here’ calling their brothers and sisters to come back home and look for new paths in their own land. Q&A with the members of FOMMA follow this performance’s video documentation.

=520  \\$aInterview with Regina José Galindo, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. Regina Galindo talks about the difference of being an artist or an activist during the years of violence in Guatemala -- she reflects upon the risks involved in the artist’s work, finally stating that, in fact, any Guatemalan is at risk in their quotidian lives. According with her clear, rational vision of art, activism is something different and more involved; for her, the role of the artist is to create artwork, which might not have a direct impact in social change, but can promote a new dialogue among citizens. Galindo strongly states that she does not think that she is changing the world; however, the fact that she is not involved in a radical change does not mean that she is not working for a better society. Therefore, she proposes a different form of resistance, through which maybe we are not changing the world, but at least we are not worsening it.
=520  \\$aRegina José Galindo (1974) was born in Guatemala City. Her work has been included in group shows like Venice-Istanbul, Museum of Modern Art, Intanbul; Into Me, Out of Me, P.S.1, New York, and Kunst-Werke Berlin; MASH, Miami; Las Fronteras del Género, Zaragoza, Spain; Estrecho Dudoso, Teoretica, Costa Rica; MENS mankind, S.M.A.K., Belgium; Courants Alternatifs, PARVIS, Paris and Bordeaux, France; Eretica, Palermo, Italy; Il Potere delle Donne, Galleria Civica di Arte Contemporanea, Trento, Italy; Produciendo Realidad, Lucca, Italy; First Festival of Corporal Art, Caracas, Venezuela; She has been invited to participate in the Moscu Biennal 2007; I Bienal Arquitectura, Arte Paisaje Islas Canarias in 2006; III Biennale of Tirana, Albania in 2005; Venice Biennal in 2001 and 2005; II Biennal in Prague in 2005; and III Biennal in Lima, Peru in 2002. She won the Golden Lion Award for young artists for her participation in the Venice Biennal in 2005.

=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña’s Border Brujo stopped by NYC to share his spoken word’s enchantments. Always at the center of discussions about US anti-immigration policies, Fulana’s Fabi Fernández opens the show reading the impossible instructions to apply for a visa to the US, while Guillermo Gómez-Peña reminds to whomever it might concern that ‘we are here precisely because you were there.’ Gómez-Peña exposes the contradictions of US anti immigration and anti Spanish language enforcement with his well-known linguistic mix that jumps from Spanish to English, Spanglish, and unknown tongues,. He also generously offers a Spanish lesson for gringo friends who have to work with Latinos (with Barbi and Fabi’s help) addressing the ups and downs of ‘intercultural’ relations. Moreover, in this particular occasion, Gómez-Peña’s persona deals with the coming of years, his fear of loosing his Chicano mojo, and his sexual pathologies with a computer. Between eroticism and imaginary political speeches, 'GGP' shows the power of spoken word, the power of performance art, and how great it feels to imagine.
=520  \\$aGuillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art. His performance work and eight books have contributed to the debates on cultural diversity, identity, and US-Mexico relations. His artwork has been presented at over seven hundred venues across the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia and Australia. He is a MacArthur Fellow, American Book Award winner, and a Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. He is a regular contributor to National Public Radio, a writer for newspapers and magazines in the US, Mexico, and Europe, and a contributing editor to The Drama Review (NYU-MIT).
=520  \\$aFulana is a video and performance collective created in 2000 by four Latinas in New York City (Cristina Ibarra, Marlène Ramírez-Cancio, Lisandra Ramos-Grullón & Andrea Thome). Using parody and satire, their work delves into topics affecting the Latino communities in the U.S., and responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed and sold to us through the mass media.

=520  \\$aInterview with David Lozano, conducted by Marlène Ramírez-Cancio, Associate Director of Arts & Media at the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, David Lozano discusses the role of the body in the intertwining dynamics between arts and politics. Lozano’s performance work explores the relational links between bodies, proposing powerful ways for evidencing and undoing embodied constructions of gender and citizenship. Considering performance as a site for surprise, and for the non-controlled, his work ‘Marca y ego: Oficios para el cuerpo’ offers a reflection upon how bodies are marked as ‘abjected,’ and how those bodies’ textures are a surface that transmits meaning. Although the body is a vulnerable territory, it also can function as a means to subvert preconceptions about the body, within the body, and from the body.
=520  \\$aDavid Lozano is a visual artist with a specialization in painting. He has a Masters degree in Visual and Fine Arts from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. He teaches at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Universidad de los Andes, Santo Tomás de Aquino and the Academy of Superior Arts of Bogotá. Currently he is a teacher and the director of the School of Visual Arts at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. As an artist, his work has focused on the investigation of the postmodern and globalized body.

=520  \\$aInterview with Julieta Paredes, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, Associate Director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Julieta Paredes underlines the centrality of a communal spirit in her work, stating that when she speaks, her voice is a resonance of the voice of her ‘compañeras.’ She questions Western notions of what ‘performance’ is, claiming that the ‘Pachamama’ (Mother Earth) has taught her and her people a cultural performance or ‘performance del pueblo.’ She also points out that the use of the term ‘performance’ might tend to highlight an aesthetic or artistic practice, which can imply a depoliticization of the contents transmitted through actions. Paredes explains how she envisions indigenous people’s communal work, working together from their bodies and sexualities, building what she calls ‘communal feminism.’ Thus, from the particularities of traditional indigenous communities, an active political participation in the public sphere can be set in motion. She also talks about the ‘acciones’ of ‘Mujeres Creando’ and later ‘Mujeres Creando Comunidad,’ which are created to engage with people in public spaces, and to communicate and transmit those social and political struggles that have been invisibilized and silenced.
=520  \\$aJulieta Paredes Carvajal is an Aymara lesbian and communitarian feminist. She was a founding member of ‘Mujeres Creando’ (Women Creating), and she worked with this collective for many years.

=520  \\$aThis is a video documentation of Julieta Paredes’ talk/performance/no-performance entitled ‘Hilando fino desde el feminismo comunitario,’ presented as part of the CLACS Research Colloquium Series ‘Decolonization in the Andes: Contemporary Debates and Transformations,’ co-organized by the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics and the Department of Performance Studies at NYU. Julieta Paredes stages a transformation during her presentation, changing from her Westernized clothes to her grandmother’s clothes, and so visibly turning into an indigenous woman, or ‘chola.’ Paredes claims that, in Bolivia, ‘nobody looks at me when I’m dressing as a chola: we become invisible.’ Stating also that ‘cholas don’t have a body, don’t have a sexuality, don’t have ideas,’ Paredes’s proposes to engage in political participation with and from her body. She insists in that which she is doing ‘is not a performance,’ but an actual transmission of her sisters and her people’s thoughts and demands through her voice and her body. In this manner, Paredes brings to presence the very topics she is discussing – being that women’s corporeality has been at the center of colonial penetration, she proposes that resistance and contestation against colonialism must come from those feminine bodies. Thus, the task of recovering women’s corporeality and sexuality is at the basis of her proposal of ‘communal feminism’. This is the first step to achieve balance between brothers and sisters, and start working side by side to regain native communities’ sovereignty.

=520  \\$aInterview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez talks about the relationship between her experience in theater and cabaret, and her political commitment as an activist. She considers that cabaret provides improvisation as a training tool to exercise negotiation and risk. Also, the immediate response of the audience transforms the artist into a medium that conveys what the public feels and thinks; in this sense, cabaret is a space both to become aware of the current political situation and to foresee what could be upcoming, which engenders a more participative audience. Jesusa Rodríguez and her Resistencia Creativa movement organized a massive ‘plantón’ (sit-in) in Mexico City’s Zócalo (main square) to protest against the controversial results of the Presidential Elections in 2006. She brought together different groups and art expressions from a wide range of Mexican citizens and collaborators, and they presented different spectacles every day during this 40-days sit-in. This demonstration was an example of the art’s role in the struggle for a country’s transformation as well as an act of generosity and solidarity. Based on her ‘artivist’ experiences, Jesusa Rodríguez asks: how art and resistance transform and energize the people little by little every day?
=520  \\$aJesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret; from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using ‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

=520  \\$aIn this interview, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia, associate director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, Moysés Zúñiga Santiago talks about his photo exhibit presented in NYC in 2010. His photos portrayed the conflict in Mitzitón, located near to San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas. Zúñiga explains the political and religious confrontation, as well as the presence of the Zapatismo in this zone. He also speaks about the role of the photojournalist, which must aim for social denounce – given the silence of the mainstream media – in spite of the danger that it involves. Finally, he discusses recent events in Mexican history, and he comments how his recent visit to New York City provoked reflections about life in the streets, and the social, linguistic, and racial contrasts that he noticed.
=520  \\$aA native of San Cristobal de Las Casas, Moysés Zuñiga Santiago began his study of science and technology at the University of Xalapa in Veracruz in 1998 where he worked in television, photography and radio. In 2003, he began work in Xalapa at Diario AZ as a photojournalist and was subsequently hired by Milenio de Veracruz as the photography editor. Beginning in January of 2006 he served as the correspondent for Mexican photography agency Cuartoscuro during Subcomandante Marcos’ ‘Other Campaign’ and traveled the entirety of Mexico with Marcos. During this time, Zúñiga also worked with the Associated Press (AP), EFE (Spain), and Agence France Press (AFP). Since 2007, Zúñiga has worked with La Jornada in San Cristóbal de Las Casas and covers the Chiapas region for the Associated Press and EFE. In 2009 he received a Rory Peck Training Fund grant for freelance journalists in high-risk areas from the Rory Peck Trust.

=520  \\$aDread Scott's performance intervention Money to Burn (2010) challenges the politics of capitalism. Performed on Wall Street in New York City, Scott repeatedly sings the phrase "Money to burn" while lighting currency on fire. The currency Scott burns includes his personal money, grant money awarded by Franklin Furnace, and donated money from pedestrians. His gesture of burning money--an action that is considered a crime in the United States under Title 18, Section 333--illuminates the epidemic of income inequality and signals for an economic system not based on profit. It is important to note that the currency Scott burns is not exchanged for any goods or services. Rather, the pyre of dollar bill ashes that form throughout the intervention becomes a site for the public to imagine an economy outside of capital gain.
=520  \\$aDread Scott makes revolutionary art to propel history forward. Scott works in a range of media including performance, installation, photography, screen-printing, and video. His artwork illuminates the oppressive structures forged by society and challenges the audience to envision a world where justice prevails. Scott has exhibited at Cristin Tierney Gallery, MoMA PS1, Whitney Museum of American Art, Winkleman Gallery, Walker Art Center, Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, and Pori Art Museum. He has presented Dread Scott: Welcome to America (2008) at the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, and Dread Scott: Decision (2012) at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Next Wave Festival. Scott's artwork is included in collections at the New Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Akron Art Museum. His public sculptures are installed at Logan Square in Philadelphia and Franconia Sculpture Park in Minnesota. He has received grants from Creative Capital Foundation, Franklin Furance, and Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Scott has also been awarded fellowships for his work from the New York Foundation for the Arts. He has been an Artist-in-Residence at OMI International Arts Center and Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.$uwww.dreadscott.net

=520  \\$aThis video recording broadcasts the presentation of archival documentation of ‘Witness of the Ruins’ by the Colombian collective Mapa Teatro as part of ‘Injured Cities: Urban Afterlives Conference,’ hosted by the Center for the Critical Analysis of Social Difference at Columbia University. This conference, convened on the tenth anniversary of the events of September 11, 2001, aimed to explore the effects of catastrophe on cities and their inhabitants, to analyze the politics of shock and terror states use in response to their vulnerability, and to imagine more life-affirming modes of redress and re-invention. Mapa Teatro’s performance/lecture compiles personal and group experiences lived while working on four projects (Prometheus, Run-throughs, The Cleaning of the Stables of Augeas, and Witness to the Ruins) inspired and materialized during the gentrification process of the neighborhood of El Cartucho in Bogota. The many layers of archive and memory are embodied through the voices and bodies of Mapa Teatro’s directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden, who show a ghostly screening of the documentation that remained after each project was created and performed, and remember the impact that they had on the families, the spectators, and themselves. The entire experience was possible because of the bonds established with the inhabitants of the neighborhood as well as the interest in creating a moving memorial monument against ‘the architecture of the emptiness.’
=520  \\$aAfter presenting the fourth project, Rolf and Heidi sit down just to witness the last archive images displaying news about the new spaces that El Cartucho’s people are trying to occupy and the empty park built on the territory where the neighborhood was. In a constant reactivation of the archive, they insert themselves in the process of remembering what they do not want to forget: the living memory of human beings that cannot be erased. Q&A and comments by Diana Taylor and Andreas Huyssen accompany this performance/lecture.
=520  \\$aOne of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation.Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

=520  \\$aInterview with Rolf Abderhalden and Heidi Abderhalden, founders and directors of Mapa Teatro, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is focused on the production, organization, theoretical conceptualization, and the experience of the project ‘Witness to the Ruins,’ created by Mapa Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood Santa Inés del Cartucho, Bogotá. The conversation discusses the notion of ‘archive’ propelled by this project, which has become a mobile memory for the city. Mapa Teatro’s work subverts and questions the inflexible coherence that an archive usually imposes to memory. During the gentrification process of Bogotá, El Cartucho’s human side was forgotten under the idea of urban progress; Mapa Teatro’s work intends to recover the memories of the citizens evicted from their neighborhood, emphasizing the role of the body as the space where remembering and forgetting become a present experience. In this way, body and presence remove themselves from the archive, and become the living voice of memory.

=520  \\$aLos Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles has produced original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in the Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and culture-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

=520  \\$aInterview with Rossana Reguillo, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Professor Reguillo speaks about how fear, interplaying with other emotions like anger and hope, is structurally used by different governments to shape politics of passions. She maps recent historical events to analyze how state authorities control fears and hopes of citizens all over the Americas. She also analyzes the conflict between the Mexican government and the ‘narco’ criminal culture as the site where politics of passions strongly emerge. For her, these convulse relationships function as machines that produce uncertainties - the basis for political emotions. Examples such as the events of September 11 illustrate how fear and anger are attributed to certain subjects, who become the ‘monsters’ to be punished. Toward the end of the interview, Professor Reguillo speaks about current civil society movements of resistance, such as Occupy Wall Street, as new expressions of political passions, and the role of young citizens as the main actors for political participation.

=520  \\$aOn October 12, 2011 Linda Ronstadt, David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, and Eugene Rodriguez and Los Cenzontles presented the closing keynote address at the Grantmakers in the Arts Conference in San Francisco. In the keynote Eugene Rodríguez reflected upon the context that gave rise to the creation of Los Cenzontles and the importance of art education to explore, to preserve, and to generate cultural practices.
=520  \\$aLos Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles has produced original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in the Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and culture-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

=520  \\$aMildred Ruiz and Steven Sapp of Universes give an artist talk about their performance work. The artist talk begins with a live excerpted performance from Ameriville, following with a screening of the group’s trajectory. Since meeting each other at Bard College in upstate New York, Steven Sapp and Mildred Ruiz have always returned to the Bronx to find and to build a run down community. In response to seeing the crime, drug use, and violence in the Bronx, Steven and Mildred created ‘The Point’ community center, where Universes became a theatre group and began a journey of making performance work. The artist talk is followed by a Q&A with audience members.
=520  \\$aUniverses is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.

=520  \\$aFeaturing David Hidalgo and Jackson Browne, The Silence narrates the impact that drug lords and the narcos have in youth’s fate. Through a brief and heartbreaking story, Los Cenzontles confronts the viewer with a reality in which a new generation of Mexicans is being swept up into the country's drug war as both killers and victims.
=520  \\$aLos Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles has produced original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in the Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and culture-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

=518  \\$aRecorded in New York City, USA on December 11, 2012.
=520  \\$aDan Fishback has been writing and performing in New York City since 2003. Major works include The Material World (2012), thirtynothing (2011) and You Will Experience Silence (2009), all directed by Stephen Brackett at Dixon Place. Fishback has received grants from the Franklin Furnace Fund (2010) and the Six Points Fellowship for Emerging Jewish Artists (2007-2009). He is also the director of the Helix Queer Performance Network, a collaboration between La MaMa Experimental Theater Club, the Hemispheric Institute of Performance & Politics, and BAX/Brooklyn Arts Exchange and he curates a wide variety of public programming, including the annual performance series La MaMa's SQUIRTS. Fishback frequently teaches workshops on performance composition and queer performance culture at BAX/Brooklyn Arts Exchange and other institutions and universities. He blogs at thematerialworld.tumblr.com.
=520  \\$aPerformance artist and playwright Dan Fishback works out some of his anxieties about queer history, gay representation, male protagonism, and the limits of the queer imagination in this vaguely academic (but not really) captial-T 'Talk,' theoretically leading toward some thoughts (and hopefully some revelations) about queer ennui, queer depression, and how the adult queer universe can strategize to prevent queer teenage suicide. Along the way, he discusses Lady Gaga, prostalgia (pro-active nostalgia), David Halperin's How to Be Gay, and Fishback's own book-in-progress, Thirtynothing, based on his solo performance of the same name. Thirtynothing explores the legacy of gay artists who died of AIDS in the 80s and 90s, and examines the generation gap between today's young gay men and the gay men who lived through the early years of the AIDS crisis.

=518  \\$aRecorded in São Paulo, Brazil on January 13, 2013.
=520  \\$aThe 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Antonio Araújo's lecture is a discussion of theatrical experiments performed in streets and public spaces of the São Paulo neighborhood of Bom Retiro during the creative process of Teatro da Vertigem's Bom Retiro 958 Metros. From the practice of the situationist-inspired dérive used as a device for field research, to improvisations, to urban games conducted in the open and in dialogue with architecture and the layout of the neighborhood - Teatro da Vertigem's whole process was marked by experiences of urban intervention. Miguel Rubio's lecture explores how dramatic languages expand and invade public space, converging with citizen actions. To this end, he looks at several recent artistic proposals that act on and in public spaces - inserting themselves into social processes in the context of contemporary Peruvian society.
=520  \\$aAntonio Araújo is Artistic Director of Teatro da Vertigem and Professor in the Department of Performing Arts of ECA-USP. With Teatro da Vertigem, he has directed O Paraíso Perdido; O Livro de Jó; Apocalipse 1, 11; BR-3; Bom Retiro 958 Metros, among other works. He has been invited to teach on site specific and urban performance internationally. He was awarded the Golden Medal in the category of Best Realization of a Production for BR-3, in the Prague Quadrennial 2011. Miguel Rubio is a director, theater researcher, and founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. His most recent directions include: Con-cierto Olvido (2010); El último ensayo (2008); Sin Título-técnica mixta (2004); Hecho en el Perú-Vitrinas para un Museo de la Memoria (2001). He is also author of Raíces y semillas: Maestros y caminos del teatro en América Latina (2011), Notas sobre el teatro (2001) and El cuerpo ausente (2008).

=520  \\$aInterview with Catherine Cole, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

She is the author of Performing South Africa’s Truth Commission: Stages of Transition (2010) and Ghana’s Concert Party Theatre (2001). Cole has co-edited the book Africa After Gender?, a special issue of Theatre Survey on ‘African and Afro-Caribbean Performance,’ a special issue of TDR: The Drama Review entitled ‘Routes of Blackface’ (2013) and she recently served as the editor of the journal Theatre Survey.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Courage II is a theater piece exploring urban violence in a country without a declared war, but whose citizens are nevertheless plagued by a paranoia generated by the security sector. This sector forcibly represses the memory of a militarized nation that has been involved in multiple wars, each financed by the arms market. The performance explores our own violence within this global context.
=520  \\$aTeresa Hernández is a theater artist with 25 years of experience in both research and practice at the intersections of dance, theater, and performance. Searching for new ways of making, narrating, and being on stage, she conducts comprehensive studies of the body, space, and text. Her work engages identity as a shifting terrain; art and its established canon; and violence and power with its mutiple faces and branches.

=520  \\$aInterview with Laura Levin, conducted Mark Matusoff. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.
=520  \\$aLaura Levin is a performance theorist whose research focuses on contemporary theatre and performance art, performing gender and sexuality, site-specific and urban performance, and intermediality in performance. She is Editor-in-Chief of Canadian Theatre Review and has edited a number of collections: an issue of Theatre Research in Canada on Space and Subjectivity in Performance; a CTR issue on Performance Art; an issue of Performance Research on Performing Publics, Conversations Across Borders (Seagull Books, 2011); and Theatre and Performance in Toronto (Playwrights Canada Press, 2011). Her current research, which focuses on gender, performance, and space, appears in several edited volumes including Judith Thompson (ed. Ric Knowles) and Space and the Geographies of Canadian Theatre (ed. Michael McKinnie), and Performance and the City (eds. Kim Solga, DJ Hopkins, and Shelley Orr). She has worked as a director and dramaturg on a number of productions in North America and several practice-based research projects that investigate intersections of performance, geography, and digital technologies. In 2008, Laura Levin was awarded a SSHRC Standard Grant for ‘The Canadian Performance Studies Project,’ the first major research study to theorize and map the field of performance studies as it has emerged in Canada. As part of this project, she chaired the annual Performance Studies International conference, which was held in Canada for the first time in June 2010. She is currently a co-investigator for the Canadian Consortium on Performance and Politics in the Americas, a SSHRC-funded partnership between NYU’s Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics and a network of performance researchers from Canadian universities.

=520  \\$aZeca Ligiéro is Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro. Since 1998, he coordinates the Center for the Study of Afro-Amerindian Performances–NEPAA. He has published Corpo a corpo: estudos das performance brasileiras (2011), Performance Afro-Ameríndia (2007); Carmen Miranda: uma performance afro-brasileira (2006), and Malandro divino: a vida e a lenda de Zé Pelintra (2004), among others.
=520  \\$aThe 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. 'Dona Mariana' is a performance about how deities and religious practices travel across borders, harboring a transformative power of sensing, healing, and sharing through the body. Being in-between corporeality, the audio waves of a radio soap opera, and difussed images on a screen, Zeca Ligiéro invokes the presence of Dona Mariana. Thus, this performance becomes a ritualistic, almost sacred, act of sharing.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond.What options for political and economic justice do people have when the electoral process has been violated or corrupted, the media sequestered in the hands of power-brokers, and official institutions cannot adjudicate in a way that is seen as transparent and legitimate? In light of this dismal state of affairs, this keynote lecture explores the resurgence and even centrality of the body in politics. As political parties fail to represent their constituencies, people are (re)learning how to represent themselves.

The clip offers a metaphorical narrative of ‘theatre of life’ to teach children to be faithful to their roots and to be strong to face the challenges of living in-between cultures. Los Cenzontles tells youth that ‘We must not live without living / Existing in the world is not easy / I can tell you / Trying to escape / Only creates problems / That is why we must live / And not merely survive.
=520  \\$aLos Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles has produced original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in the Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and culture-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

=520  \\$a'Luis Antonio - Gabriela,' by Companhia Mungunzá de Teatro, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary - in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES | ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex ‘passions’ that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present - fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others.
=520  \\$aThe scenic documentary Luis Antonio - Gabriela begins in 1953 with the birth of Luis Antonio who spent his childhood, adolescence, and part of his youth in Santos before leaving for Spain. The show was created from testimonies of the actor and director, Nelson Baskerville, to his sister Maria Cristina, his stepmother Doracy, and Serginho, a hairdresser in Santos and friend to Luis Antonio. The story ends in 2006, the year of his death in Bilbao, where he had lived until then as Gabriela.
=520  \\$aCompanhia Mungunzá de Teatro was created in São Paulo in 2006 by from a newly formed group of actors motivated to deepen techniques learned in school in order to develop a detailed study of Brecht’s Epic Theatre as well as other contemporary dramatic languages. They have participated in diverse festivals in Brazil, winning 26 awards in various categories. www.ciamungunza.com.br

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Mestizo Orpheus tells of the return of a politician to his past and his connection to military dictatorship. A phone call about the disinterment of the body of his companion Eurydice places Orpheus in contact with a past that he has tried to forget. Responding to conflict, this text is inspired by the Orphic myths and incoporates multilple characters from different epochs, who each help guide Orpheus in his descent into hell.
=520  \\$aNúcleo Bartolomeu de Depoimentos works with language at the union of hip hop and epic theatre to create hip-hop theatre, a pioneering concept in Brazil that opens numerous possibilities and fields of action, dialoguing with the trends and diversity of urban culture.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The recent capitalist development in Brazil has led to the institutionalization of cultural production. Research in the arts, which had previously worked against the grain of dominant logics, is now frequently a conformist site of alternative inclusion within capital’s ideological order. Group Theater in São Paulo and the Commodification of Culture explores how dissonant voices in this process - including those of some São Paulo theater groups - are now looking for critical ways to confront the depoliticization and commodification that has been imposed by and is a result of the bare necessities of survival.

He is the editor of Vintém and Traulito, and author of Atuação Crítica and Introdução ao Teatro Dialético (2009).

=520  \\$aThe 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. From a micropolitical perspective, the unconscious repression of the knowing-body is the greatest violence of the colonial enterprise. This keynote lecture examines how this violence is in the marrow of the modern Western culture that continues to structure our lives. Today, the toxic effects of this unconscious repression have reached a critical point, generating the vast crisis in which we are now immersed. In order to return to the knowing-body - free from the effects of trauma - it is necessary that we resist the actual state of things. This is not a matter of futurology, for signs of this return are emerging throughout the 'Global South' - a South that is multiple and whose borders are not geographically limited. These signs of return are blasts of oxygen at points where thought has been asphyxiated - a tireless redrawing of landscapes, an endless work. Is this the real political potency of art?

He is currently coordinator of the Masters program in Cultural Studies at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú and a principal researcher at the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos (IEP).
=520  \\$aThe 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The Poetics of Grief explores how citizens are questioned and challenged through and by symbolic interventions in public space. The latter call attention to the dangers of forgetting crucial past events - events that move us away from triumphalism and insist, over and over again, on the need to continue processing the worst of the past. In this lecture, Vich analyzes three public interventions performed in contemporary Peru, which each reopened discussions concerning political violence.

=520  \\$aThe Hemispheric Institute's 9th Encuentro, held at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, sought to explore the multiple valences of the term MANIFEST! How are performances mobilized and syncretized in civic, community, and cultural contexts to create manifold forms of political expression? How do public, theatrical events produce ‘evidence’ that manifests ideas otherwise invisible, hidden, or unspeakable? What new manifestations, manifestos, festivals, and manifs emerge via our changing visions of political spaces, intellectual arenas, and the everyday street? The 2014 Encuentro invited artists, activists, and scholars to engage with and investigate the aesthetic, social, and choreographic techniques that transform political ideas into collective images, through actions, embodied utterances, and ways of being. Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. Flagrantly fanciful and subversive, the protest ensemble Anonymous became widely popular among some Internet geeks, political activists, and academics along with many unmarked spectators. In this keynote lecture, Gabriella Coleman examines Anonymous' popular appeal through the vantage point of their art, artistry, and trickery.

Homage opens wounds that have healed on Grey's body in order to reactivate the psychic energy stored there and to invite the audience to eradicate the boundaries between us.
