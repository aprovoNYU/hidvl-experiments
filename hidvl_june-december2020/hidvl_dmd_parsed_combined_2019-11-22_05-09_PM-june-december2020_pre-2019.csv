As US casualties and war debts pile up from the Iraq War, it's always great to remember why we're fighting. Here's a hint: it's not freedom, Uncle Sam... it's that black gold that warms our hearts! Stay tuned!- Hip-Hop videos! MC 50 Mil spits hot bars and gives us a sneak peak at the young black Billionaire lifestyle. Keep it real in this cringeworthy imitation of ealy 2000's rap videos, complete with gaudy mansion, flashy rental cars, and scantilty clad women! Because sometimes even a landed billionaire wants to party like the nouveau rich!- Street interventions with trained imposters! The Billionaires show up in New York City to intercept Karl Rove on his way to meet George W. Bush's Maverick fundraisers. With environmentalists already on hand protesting the administration's response to the September 11th attacks, it's a good old-fashioned protest party!- Environmentalist Party Crashing! Phil T Rich and Monet Oliver De Place crash the stage at a Bioneer's conference, dropping the cold hard facts to a captive audience of eco-apologists. Ever the orators, the silver-tongued Billionaires defend the Bush Administrations's healthy forest initiatives (such as logging) and extol the hidden virtues of global warming (great tans!) to the cackles and heckles of their political and ideological opposites.

The Billionaires for Bush hit the streets in Philadelphia to auction off the Liberty Bell and pay for trillions of dollars in U.S. tax cuts. Through a varied extravaganza of speeches, chants, and song and dance, the noble descendants of our founding fathers re-declare their dependence on foreign labor, foreign oil and foreign wars.
