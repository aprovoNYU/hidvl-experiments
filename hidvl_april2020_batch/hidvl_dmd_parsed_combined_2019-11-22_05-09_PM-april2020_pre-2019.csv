Throughscatological markmaking, I aim to 'pollute' this phallogocentrism.

Butterfly (After Shigeko Kubota) is citational by design. In1960, La Monte Young wrote his Composition 1960 #5, which instructs theperformer to “Turn a butterfly (or any number of butterflies) loose inthe performance area.” In 1965, Shigeko Kubota performed Vagina Paintingat the Perpetual Fluxus Festival, Cinemateque, NYC.

The Front de libération du Québec's kidnapping of JamesCross and Pierre Laporte were met by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’sinvoking of the War Measures Act. Across Canada, civil liberties weresuspended as Canadian Forces patrolled Montréal streets. These eventsfueled the already-swelling Québec sovereignty movement in the decadesthat followed. Forty years later, how are these events remembered?A Measure of War (Je me souviens) is a site-specific public performance inwhich seemingly disconnected historical events and public speeches are‘remixed’––both culturally and linguistically––encouraging ourcollective amnesia to remember things as they never were. How do weunderstand Trudeau’s speech on October 16, 1970, or the FLQ Manifesto,when it is read not only in English and French––official languages of abilingual Canada––but in a third language? How do we respond to thedissonance produced by overlapping layers of conflicted histories,including the ambivalent history of multiculturalism?On October 16, 2010, the public was invited to participate in thisperformance by riding their bicycles alongside Khang’s pedal-poweredmini-tank all the way to Montréal City Hall.
