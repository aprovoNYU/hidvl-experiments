He tells a personal story spanning 30 years, from the 1960s to the 1980s, and a multitude of places, always returning to Miami. The narrative opens with a prophecy revealed to his mother about her future children's destinies: one will be a politician, another will go to jail and the third will be an actor. The following story uses ritual, music, and other historical references to explore the struggles of identity and belonging for Puerto Ricans in Miami. The war against drugs, migration and Puerto Rican independence movements mark time and space in this piece, packed inside a family tale, where brotherhood is the unifying element. In Third Trinity, the effects of substance abuse, drug dealing, and the US criminal justice system come to bear on Teo's characters, particularly himself and his brother. As he shifts between characters, Teo's mother remains the primary narrator in a piece that explores the power of prophecy and trinity amongst three generations, three decades, and three brothers' stories.

Teo Castellanos represents the complex relations between the Hatian, Jamaican, Cuban, Puertorican, LGTBQ, African American and Jewish populations. The physical street is used as a narrative device to articulate differing stories and timelines. The infusion of music creates a path between cultures that often seem to conflict and diverge, but often do overlap.

The performance exposes the contradiction of ""serving"" a country that is still at odds with Puerto Ricans' rights as U.S. citizens. Moreover, AMAL draws parallels between generations of soldiers through chronicling the Utuado uprising and overwhelming use of force by U.S. military against the Puerto Rican population, the Vietnam War and the subsequent opioid abuse amongst veterans, as well as the Jones–Shafroth Act, where U.S. president Woodrow Wilson granted citizenship to Puerto Ricans, just as the country was entering World War I, thus using the mandatory draft to enlist more than 18,000 Puerto Ricans. In exploring the more recent history of U.S. involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts, characters point out the connections between Arab populations and their own ancestries as people of color. AMAL makes clear the tensions inherent in a sense of national belonging founded on militarized violence and warfare for Puerto Ricans, leading one character to offer the reminder that, ""Our people have been a people, long before 'we, the people.'""","Teo Castellanos is an actor/writer/director, who works in theater, film and television.

In this play, Salvadorian refugee Fausto is determined to turn his life around and prevent his son from following the violent path he had to endure. The painful and lengthy tattoo removal procedure serves as a metaphor for Fausto's own life journey. A tattoo, a symbol of permanence, poses the question: can a person ever erase their own past? ""There is no such a thing as a 'former' gang member, but there might be a second chance,"" says Fausto in his opening monologue. Paul Flores also portrays the difficult migration dynamics faced by people fleeing the Salvadorian Civil War. Fausto's son grew up ostracized inside a migrant neighborhood in San Francisco, where he loathes his father and his past, but he might nonetheless mirror his father's steps because of the limited life choices available to him.

The disabled here are presented as powerful, sexual, graceful subjects, seeking self-knowledge through movement and touch.

As with each successive GIMP manifestation, here we see Latsky’s growing ambition to open up dance to non-normative bodies and modes of mobilization; the ensemble for If is her most diverse to date, comprised of twenty dancers spanning a wide range of ages and body types, abilities and disabilities. A mid-performance tableau emerges after a dancer glides across the stage on rollerblades, soon joined by another turning tricks in a wheelchair. Gradually, the rest of the ensemble enters the scene; they laboriously drag themselves on their stomachs to a row of chairs lining the front of the stage, ultimately bringing themselves to a seated position, where they sit, still, staring at the audience, breathing deeply. This moment is signature of Latsky's work, where she throws physical variation into relief, allowing viewers the time and space to admire the beauty of physical difference, while simultaneously engaging the audience in a prolonged staring contest that is both an act of communion and a challenge to consider the way we see and are seen. And as in her original GIMP (2009), Latsky themes each section around a little-known meaning of “gimp” (e.g., “to tremble with ecstasy” and “a ribbon-like braided fabric”), thereby reclaiming the word from epithet and signaling her broader project of destigmatization.","The mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

Here we see her first exploring ways of using the provocative display of physical otherness to reframe dominant perceptions of the disabled body and challenge unmarked [able-ist] aesthetics and cultural ideologies. Comprising five movement tableaux, Five Open Mouths, begins with Bufano in silhouette, posed beside a chair, standing on C-clamp leg prostheses, striking a cyborgian figure. As the lights come up, they reveal her staring back at the audience—a perceptual exchange that interpellates her viewers into the performance and a stare that affirms her own visibility as an act of choice. When, next, she bounds fearlessly about the stage, she is both claiming the space and her body’s right to it. The performance unfolds with Bufano seated, stripping away her prostheses to expose the foreshortened contours of her limbs. Lowering herself from the chair, she engages in a lengthy, virtuosic dance that turns increasingly sensual and introspective. The piece concludes with Bufano back in the chair, performing a series of tender unravelling gestures (evocations of her post-surgery removal of bandages) that, accompanied by Cyndi Lauper’s """"La Vie en Rose,"""" read as a danced ballad to her own radically different body.","The mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

The piece opens with Goldhuber in a cassock-like outfit with an impossibly long train, slowly traversing a corridor of light while dragging Latsky, curled up, as well as his own effigy distantly behind him: a potent visual metaphor for the ways the body carries personal and social corporeal histories of violence. Drawing on vaudeville, dance theater, and German expressionism, Worst Case Scenario alternates such sinister, starkly lit tableaux with broadly comic vignettes of stylized combat and conflict. Anti-semitism courses beneath, hinted at in Dill’s photographic projections of Latsky and Goldhuber stripped naked, their bodies scrawled with oblique invective (e.g. TK), and surfacing occasionally, as in the recurrence of Phranc’s folk-punk anthem “Little Hitlers” (""Take Off Your Swastika—It's Making Me Angry” “Sure I got Jewish damage. What they hell do you expect?”). Throughout, hate is presented as a dark discursive undertow, a perpetually murmuring (and muting) subtext that inscribes itself on bodies, bringing transgenerational histories of trauma into the lived, embodied present.","The mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

Latsky opens the video in rehearsal clothes, speaking to the camera as she recounts her initial trimester on bed rest and her subsequent desire to ""start dancing again...to see what I could do."" The dance that follows juxtaposes gestural evocations of modern, scientized pregnancy with iconographies of transcendental motherhood, as we see Latsky exploring her new body in what is simultaneously a self-portrait of dancing maternity and a pursuit of embodied knowledge.

Jones and Justice Allen, Justice's Leg (1992) foretells Heidi Latsky’s disability work in its focus on the subjective experience of bodily trauma. In the piece, Allen narrates and reenacts the story of a legendary prison football game he starred in two decades prior. As his tale unfolds, Latsky begins to hurl herself at Allen in a series of flying tackles and his story turns increasingly dark until, at its climax, Allen's leg is broken as the result of a prison bounty. The injury sets in motion a series of botched surgeries, leaving Allen permanently disfigured, with one leg two inches shorter than the other. Blending dance-theater and monologue, modern dance and football vernacular, Justice's Leg narrates an autobiographical account of a Black man's bodily experience of violence, disfigurement, and mass incarceration.

In a later iteration, Justice’s Leg is performed alongside another piece, You Have the Right . . . Imagine . . . I'm Afraid of Silence, in which a naked Black man dressed in a KKK hood menaces Justice with Miranda-type warnings—""""You have the right to remain silent. Do you understand?” “You have the right to be made outcast and to be ridiculed. Do you understand?""""—that render explicit the role of the modern carceral state as an instrument of White racial hegemony.","The mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

Here, the longtime friends and collaborators comically and hyperbolically center their vast differences in physicality--Latsky is short and petite while Goldhuber is a much taller and larger person--as well as notions of virtuosity. They begin the performance in matching ensembles that accentuate the choreographic attention to each dancer's physicality. Throughout each of the performance's five segments—""Too Much, Too Little, Too Bad!, Hate (Worst Case Scenario excerpts), Modern, Dance—the dancers exploreand resist conventional ideas about each of their physicalities and perceived limitations. Through Latsky's and Goldhuber's pairing and the scaffolding of each vignette, the performers' movements thoughtfully attend to modern dance as a form and its implications on partnering, weight, and emotionality.
