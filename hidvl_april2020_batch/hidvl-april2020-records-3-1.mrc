"If Kubota challenged the works of male artists like Pollock, Klein, andPaik––by counterposing the female body's productivity to the masculinepainterly gestures loaded with phallic symbolism––I want my work to beread against two forces. First, (East) Asian calligraphy. Manypractitioners believe in a link between male virility and the strength ofhis brush stroke, the brush tip standing in for the phallus. Throughscatological markmaking, I aim to 'pollute' this phallogocentrism. Second,I want to interrogate the white gaze, and how the Asian body, or for thatmatter, Asia as a body, is feminized (see Said)." - David Khang, an excerptfrom Interview with Glenn Alteen, brunt magazine, Issue #1.  pMedia source original: a1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Butterfly (After Shigeko Kubota) is citational by design. In1960, La Monte Young wrote his Composition 1960 #5, which instructs theperformer to “Turn a butterfly (or any number of butterflies) loose inthe performance area.” In 1965, Shigeko Kubota performed Vagina Paintingat the Perpetual Fluxus Festival, Cinemateque, NYC. In 1988, David HenryHwang’s play M. Butterfly premiered on Broadway, NYC. In 2007, thesehistorically significant pieces—all performed in NYC—become departurepoints that converge in one re-mixed performance, with the potential fordivergent readings with contemporary social, political, racial, and sexualimplications. Through this piece, reinterpreting performance works from thepast becomes a means of re-imagining new poetic and political strategiesfor the present.  pMedia source original: a1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

The project remembers the 1973 military coup led by General AugustoPinochet and supported by both the CIA and the Chicago School, which soughtto overturn Chile's socialist movement. A bicycle-powered miniature tank(referencing the tanks used in the first coup, attempt earlier that year)becomes the vehicle for reciting and remembering Salvador Allende's finalpresidential speech before his death. The speech is read in Spanish andKorean. The work is completed in Valdivia, Chile, as pink military fatiguesare painted copper––or cobre––one of the driving forces of theChilean economy, and one of the few industries that remained in publiccontrol after the post-coup privatization. This performance is part of theWrong Places series, an ongoing series of site-specific publicperformances. For each, Khang researched specific geopolitical historiesand juxtaposed and/or remixed seemingly disparate events. In this way,Khang produces dissonant as well as consonant readings, and works tore-imagine these events' poetic and political potentials.  pMedia source original: a1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Forty-five years later, this speech is translated intoKorean, recited for an Anglophone audience, while wearing a Korean militaryuniform painted in UN-blue.

After the performance, the blue uniform is painted pink (a referenceto the term "pinkos," used to label Communist sympathizers). Through theconflicted emotional memory and prism of an era that represented hopes forsocial justice, the contemporary political climate is re-interpreted andreevaluated.This is the second project in an ongoing series of site-specific publicperformances titled Wrong Places.

The Front de libération du Québec's kidnapping of JamesCross and Pierre Laporte were met by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’sinvoking of the War Measures Act. Across Canada, civil liberties weresuspended as Canadian Forces patrolled Montréal streets. These eventsfueled the already-swelling Québec sovereignty movement in the decadesthat followed. Forty years later, how are these events remembered?A Measure of War (Je me souviens) is a site-specific public performance inwhich seemingly disconnected historical events and public speeches are‘remixed’––both culturally and linguistically––encouraging ourcollective amnesia to remember things as they never were. How do weunderstand Trudeau’s speech on October 16, 1970, or the FLQ Manifesto,when it is read not only in English and French––official languages of abilingual Canada––but in a third language? How do we respond to thedissonance produced by overlapping layers of conflicted histories,including the ambivalent history of multiculturalism?On October 16, 2010, the public was invited to participate in thisperformance by riding their bicycles alongside Khang’s pedal-poweredmini-tank all the way to Montréal City Hall. While wearing militaryfatigues, Khang recited the notable public enunciations from forty yearsago, spliced together in three languages. Using a paintball gun, a symbolicexecution of Pierre Laporte was carried out with the help of willingmembers of the public.  pMedia source original: a1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Employing the chryalis as ametaphor, Khang finishes reading, removes his camaflouge fatigues anduncovers the military tank in the background to reveal a butterfly soldierand vehicle. The tank––with a tricycle inside––is maneuveuredthrough the gallery space. The audience is saluted and thanked.

In performing, Khang often embodies these languages to interrogate social constructions – of gender, race, and interspecies relations – that are present within dominant historic narratives in contemporary culture. By strategically employing non-native languages and code switching, Khang produces divergent, dissonant, and often hyperbolic and humorous readings that re-imagine the poetic and the political.  pMedia source original: a1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

He tells a personal story spanning 30 years, from the 1960s to the 1980s, and a multitude of places, always returning to Miami. The narrative opens with a prophecy revealed to his mother about her future children's destinies: one will be a politician, another will go to jail and the third will be an actor. The following story uses ritual, music, and other historical references to explore the struggles of identity and belonging for Puerto Ricans in Miami. The war against drugs, migration and Puerto Rican independence movements mark time and space in this piece, packed inside a family tale, where brotherhood is the unifying element. In Third Trinity, the effects of substance abuse, drug dealing, and the US criminal justice system come to bear on Teo's characters, particularly himself and his brother. As he shifts between characters, Teo's mother remains the primary narrator in a piece that explores the power of prophecy and trinity amongst three generations, three decades, and three brothers' stories. Oscar winner and MacArthur Genius fellowship recipient Tarrel Alvin McCraney was in charge of Dramaturgy and Directing.  aTeo Castellanos is an actor/writer/director, who works in theater, film and television.

Teo Castellanos represents the complex relations between the Hatian, Jamaican, Cuban, Puertorican, LGTBQ, African American and Jewish populations. The physical street is used as a narrative device to articulate differing stories and timelines. The infusion of music creates a path between cultures that often seem to conflict and diverge, but often do overlap. This performance centers the marginalized populations of Miami and the racism and discrimination that pollutes every interaction while nonetheless shining a light on their commonalities, in deep acknowledgement of what binds humanity together.  aTeo Castellanos is an actor/writer/director, who works in theater, film and television.

Set partly in the 1970's, it tells the story of three characters inside East Harlem. One character is a Vietnam veteran who struggles with addiction after coming back to his community. Another is a left-wing militant reflecting on "the people's" relationship with police and state structures. The third is a young Latino surrounded by gang violence and drug trafficking. Each part of the trilogy focuses on a different aspect of the community that ties the three characters together. Policies such as the draft that most adversely affected minorities and aided the U.S. military in the Vietnam campaign, the persecution of justice movement figures within marginilized communities, and the devastating results of the war on drugs all come to bear in this work. At its core, War, Revolution and The Projects questions what is meant by the phrase "the common good," while also posing other uncomfortable questions about who truly benefits from political warfare.  pMedia source original: a1 videocassette VHS 1/2 in.

Moreover, AMAL draws parallels between generations of soldiers through chronicling the Utuado uprising and overwhelming use of force by U.S. military against the Puerto Rican population, the Vietnam War and the subsequent opioid abuse amongst veterans, as well as the Jones–Shafroth Act, where U.S. president Woodrow Wilson granted citizenship to Puerto Ricans, just as the country was entering World War I, thus using the mandatory draft to enlist more than 18,000 Puerto Ricans. In exploring the more recent history of U.S. involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts, characters point out the connections between Arab populations and their own ancestries as people of color. AMAL makes clear the tensions inherent in a sense of national belonging founded on militarized violence and warfare for Puerto Ricans, leading one character to offer the reminder that, "Our people have been a people, long before 'we, the people.'  aTeo Castellanos is an actor/writer/director, who works in theater, film and television.

In this play, Salvadorian refugee Fausto is determined to turn his life around and prevent his son from following the violent path he had to endure. The painful and lengthy tattoo removal procedure serves as a metaphor for Fausto's own life journey. A tattoo, a symbol of permanence, poses the question: can a person ever erase their own past? "There is no such a thing as a 'former' gang member, but there might be a second chance," says Fausto in his opening monologue. Paul Flores also portrays the difficult migration dynamics faced by people fleeing the Salvadorian Civil War. Fausto's son grew up ostracized inside a migrant neighborhood in San Francisco, where he loathes his father and his past, but he might nonetheless mirror his father's steps because of the limited life choices available to him. The quest for belonging, familiarity, and community are at the heart of the play, where familial and kinship models, based on either blood or violent allegiance, are blurred.  pMedia source original: a1 DVD  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

This one man play explores the intersections of culture, heritage and economic class, all colliding in the face of changing times. In the same vein as Sarah Jones and Anna Deavere Smith, a single performer represents a mosaic of characters. From the immigrant minorities that have built the community in the Mission District, to the newly arrived hegemonic whites, there is a multitude of voices in this multicultural, intergenerational piece. Some featured characters are a Chicano poet, a wise street poetry dealer, an angry Latina neighbor, and a tech worker who is the face of gentrification in the neighborhood. You're Gonna Cry is a performance driven by humor, personal storytelling and even the surreal, as beer cans talk and fight with each other.

Paul tries to connect with his political views by traveling to La Havana and supporting his idea of revolution. Conversely, Julio, who grew up during Cuba's revolution, attempts to achieve success in Hip-Hop, a cultural import of the United States. Both become friends and decide to travel to New York City together, but when the terrorist attacks of 9/11 happen their plans drastically change. The renewed xenophobia and racism erodes both characters' dreams, as they realize neither had a complete understanding of the other. As one character notes, "He had his view of things and I got mine, we were both wrong". In this performance, two sides of Cuban and North American relationality are constantly challenged, as both characters reflect on the meaning of representar (to represent), a term each uses to express his identity and rootedness in Latino cultural and artistic diasporas.  pMedia source original: a1 DVD  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

The piece’s title signals her provocative intent: to reclaim a stigmatizing epithet as a politically radical alternative to “disabled” and, perhaps, as a badge of identity. Working with eight dancers—four abled, four dis-/differently abled—Latsky rejects universalist standards of beauty and virtuosity, instead pursuing individualized virtuosities by mining each dancer’s unique physical and expressive qualities to create “movement portraits.” Throughout the piece she seizes on ways of disturbing normative expectations of disabled bodies. The disabled here are presented as powerful, sexual, graceful subjects, seeking self-knowledge through movement and touch. At times the subversion takes a self-reflexive turn, as when a dancer with cerebral palsy turns to the audience and parrots the stigmatizing language often directed at disabled performers: ‘‘This is really incredible! I didn’t expect you to move. I thought this was going to be weird.’’ This moment underscores the scope of Latsky’s ambition: by bringing normative and non-normative bodies into performative dialogue, she seeks not only to upend dance convention but to challenge the very discourses foundational to the abled/disabled binary.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

As with each successive GIMP manifestation, here we see Latsky’s growing ambition to open up dance to non-normative bodies and modes of mobilization; the ensemble for If is her most diverse to date, comprised of twenty dancers spanning a wide range of ages and body types, abilities and disabilities. A mid-performance tableau emerges after a dancer glides across the stage on rollerblades, soon joined by another turning tricks in a wheelchair. Gradually, the rest of the ensemble enters the scene; they laboriously drag themselves on their stomachs to a row of chairs lining the front of the stage, ultimately bringing themselves to a seated position, where they sit, still, staring at the audience, breathing deeply. This moment is signature of Latsky's work, where she throws physical variation into relief, allowing viewers the time and space to admire the beauty of physical difference, while simultaneously engaging the audience in a prolonged staring contest that is both an act of communion and a challenge to consider the way we see and are seen. And as in her original GIMP (2009), Latsky themes each section around a little-known meaning of “gimp” (e.g., “to tremble with ecstasy” and “a ribbon-like braided fabric”), thereby reclaiming the word from epithet and signaling her broader project of destigmatization.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

The piece’s title signals her provocative intent: to reclaim a stigmatizing epithet as a politically radical alternative to “disabled” and, perhaps, as a badge of identity. Working with eight dancers—four abled, four dis-/differently abled—Latsky rejects universalist standards of beauty and virtuosity, instead pursuing individualized virtuosities by mining each dancer’s unique physical and expressive qualities to create “movement portraits.” Throughout the piece she seizes on ways of disturbing normative expectations of disabled bodies. The disabled here are presented as powerful, sexual, graceful subjects, seeking self-knowledge through movement and touch. At times the subversion takes a self-reflexive turn, as when a dancer with cerebral palsy turns to the audience and parrots the stigmatizing language often directed at disabled performers: ‘‘This is really incredible! I didn’t expect you to move. I thought this was going to be weird.’’ This moment underscores the scope of Latsky’s ambition: by bringing normative and non-normative bodies into performative dialogue, she seeks not only to upend dance convention but to challenge the very discourses that secure the abled/disabled binary.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Here we see her first exploring ways of using the provocative display of physical otherness to reframe dominant perceptions of the disabled body and challenge unmarked [able-ist] aesthetics and cultural ideologies. Comprising five movement tableaux, Five Open Mouths, begins with Bufano in silhouette, posed beside a chair, standing on C-clamp leg prostheses, striking a cyborgian figure. As the lights come up, they reveal her staring back at the audience—a perceptual exchange that interpellates her viewers into the performance and a stare that affirms her own visibility as an act of choice. When, next, she bounds fearlessly about the stage, she is both claiming the space and her body’s right to it. The performance unfolds with Bufano seated, stripping away her prostheses to expose the foreshortened contours of her limbs. Lowering herself from the chair, she engages in a lengthy, virtuosic dance that turns increasingly sensual and introspective. The piece concludes with Bufano back in the chair, performing a series of tender unravelling gestures (evocations of her post-surgery removal of bandages) that, accompanied by Cyndi Lauper’s ""La Vie en Rose,"" read as a danced ballad to her own radically different body.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

The piece opens with Goldhuber in a cassock-like outfit with an impossibly long train, slowly traversing a corridor of light while dragging Latsky, curled up, as well as his own effigy distantly behind him: a potent visual metaphor for the ways the body carries personal and social corporeal histories of violence. Drawing on vaudeville, dance theater, and German expressionism, Worst Case Scenario alternates such sinister, starkly lit tableaux with broadly comic vignettes of stylized combat and conflict. Anti-semitism courses beneath, hinted at in Dill’s photographic projections of Latsky and Goldhuber stripped naked, their bodies scrawled with oblique invective (e.g. TK), and surfacing occasionally, as in the recurrence of Phranc’s folk-punk anthem “Little Hitlers” ("Take Off Your Swastika—It's Making Me Angry” “Sure I got Jewish damage. What they hell do you expect?”). Throughout, hate is presented as a dark discursive undertow, a perpetually murmuring (and muting) subtext that inscribes itself on bodies, bringing transgenerational histories of trauma into the lived, embodied present.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

The dance that follows juxtaposes gestural evocations of modern, scientized pregnancy with iconographies of transcendental motherhood, as we see Latsky exploring her new body in what is simultaneously a self-portrait of dancing maternity and a pursuit of embodied knowledge.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

Jones and Justice Allen, Justice's Leg (1992) foretells Heidi Latsky’s disability work in its focus on the subjective experience of bodily trauma. In the piece, Allen narrates and reenacts the story of a legendary prison football game he starred in two decades prior. As his tale unfolds, Latsky begins to hurl herself at Allen in a series of flying tackles and his story turns increasingly dark until, at its climax, Allen's leg is broken as the result of a prison bounty. The injury sets in motion a series of botched surgeries, leaving Allen permanently disfigured, with one leg two inches shorter than the other. Blending dance-theater and monologue, modern dance and football vernacular, Justice's Leg narrates an autobiographical account of a Black man's bodily experience of violence, disfigurement, and mass incarceration.  In a later iteration, Justice’s Leg is performed alongside another piece, You Have the Right . . . Imagine . . . I'm Afraid of Silence, in which a naked Black man dressed in a KKK hood menaces Justice with Miranda-type warnings—""You have the right to remain silent. Do you understand?” “You have the right to be made outcast and to be ridiculed. Do you understand?""—that render explicit the role of the modern carceral state as an instrument of White racial hegemony.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.

In Association with Goldhuber & Latsky Project, Inc.0 aDancers: Heidi Latsky and Lawrence Goldhuber  aThe Joyce Theater, New York, NY, USA  aI Hate Modern Dance (2000) is one of the final pieces borne from the collaboration with Heidi Latsky and Lawrence Goldhuber (Goldhuber & Latsky 1993-2000). Here, the longtime friends and collaborators comically and hyperbolically center their vast differences in physicality--Latsky is short and petite while Goldhuber is a much taller and larger person--as well as notions of virtuosity. They begin the performance in matching ensembles that accentuate the choreographic attention to each dancer's physicality. Throughout each of the performance's five segments—"Too Much, Too Little, Too Bad!, Hate (Worst Case Scenario excerpts), Modern, Dance—the dancers exploreand resist conventional ideas about each of their physicalities and perceived limitations. Through Latsky's and Goldhuber's pairing and the scaffolding of each vignette, the performers' movements thoughtfully attend to modern dance as a form and its implications on partnering, weight, and emotionality.  aThe mission of Heidi Latsky Dance (HLD) is to redefine beauty and virtuosity through performance and discourse, using performers with unique attributes to bring rigorous, passionate and provocative contemporary dance to diverse audiences.
