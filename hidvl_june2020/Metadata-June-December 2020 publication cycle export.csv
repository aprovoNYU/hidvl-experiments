Urban Bush Women founder Jawole Willa Jo Zollar introduces the performance by detailing her travels to Jamaica, Nigeria, Brazil, and other sites where dance styles, unlike ballet, celebrate the movement of the hips and the buttocks as ""the most natural thing in the world."" Batty, the Patois term for buttocks, is thus a celebration of the bodies and cultures that, as Zollar recounts, are often shamed and marginalized in more Eurocentric dance forms and culture. Soul Deep is a rich entanglement with the Black jazz tradition. The Urban Bush Women dancers, led by Zollar, dance in rhythm to, and in dialogue with the David Murray Octet Symphony, performing an Arodiasporic cornerstone: the call and response. Employing jazz tools such as improvisation, vocality, and others, the female performers—and the male orator seated off-stage—form a polyphonic movement composed of both music and dance, and firmly rooted in Black expressive traditions.","Urban Bush Women galvanizes artists, activists, audiences and communities through performances, artist development, education and community engagement.

Throughout the performance, the actors start to develop peripheral scenes, creating new relational vectors with and between the audience. Characters such as superheroes, a football player, samba dancers, beggars, and gypsies bring up reflections about the superficiality behind stereotypes and what exists behind the so-called “cultural identity” of each country, addressing issues such as globalized cultural constructions and their implications on language, geography, and politics. The performance is the result of the Brazil-Romania project: Bucharest-Florianópolis, which consisted of an artistic exchange between ERRO Grupo and the Romanian playwright Peca Stefan, and other cultural exchanges between Brazil and Romania mediated by ERRO and Romanian culture professionals in 2014. According to ERRO, Geografia Inutil… indicates the points of intersection between the two countries and reveals the stereotypes sold on art itself, questioning the way they are used as a market boost and tourist exploitation of both: “Romania is sold like the country of gypsies and Dracula; the hidden and unexplored beauty of Europe.
