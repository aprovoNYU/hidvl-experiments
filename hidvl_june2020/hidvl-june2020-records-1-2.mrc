Her work has appeared in many publications, including Rattapallax, Nocturnes, Spoken Word Revolution Redux, Ploughshares, Mandorla, P.M.S., jubilat, Everything But the Burden, ART21 Magazine, Palabra, and Fence. The 8th Floor, founded in 2010 by Shelley and Donald Rubin, is an exhibition and performance space that promotes independent artistic and cultural initiatives.

Nevada Diggs performs a series of poems with a drummer, blending the spoken word with song. Diggs employs multiple languages, referencing song lyrics and found texts, all of which are centered around female bodies, specifically how society enables disposability of bodies through aging. This is especially evident in the treatment of Black and brown women. Despite the widespread nature of the ageism and disposability, LaTasha often aproaches the topics in a humorous manner. She also uses electronic effects to manipulate her voice, looping and distorting  while navigating between spoken word and musical improvisation with constant drum accompaniment.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

His performance practice, anchored by his work in Assembly – a diversion program for court-court-involved youth, is participatory in nature and invested in a process of embodiment. Leonardo's work has been featured at The Guggenheim Museum, the High Line, and New Museum, with solo exhibitions at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) and Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland (MoCA). The 8th Floor, founded in 2010 by Shelley and Donald Rubin, is an exhibition and performance space that promotes independent artistic and cultural initiatives.

Pickens. First, the performers learn self-defense techniques that could serve them against an uneven use of authority. Then, Shaun reads a script based on Nina Simone's ideas on freedom and love, quoting from the 1970's documentary "Nina: An Historical Perspective." Participants subsequently choose an action that matches their perception of the text. This participatory performance reflects on the strong links a community can develop in order to resist oppressive policies, with particular attention paid to the relationship between communities of color and the police.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

He recently performed political standup for Martha Wilson’s Activist History Teach-in at The 8th Floor in New York and for Little Injustice at Galéria HIT in Bratslava, Slovakia. In 2016 his play Unburdened had a staged reading at Meet Factory, Prague in 2016 and inspired an installation as part of Enacting Stillness at The 8th Floor in New York. He is the lead in Ayesha, a fiction short about a hate crime, showing in the fall at Anthology Film Archives in the East Village.The 8th Floor, founded in 2010 by Shelley and Donald Rubin, is an exhibition and performance space that promotes independent artistic and cultural initiatives. Inspired by The Shelley and Donald Rubin Foundation, the gallery is committed to broadening the access and availability of art to New York audiences. Seeking further cultural exchange, The 8th Floor explores the potential of art as an instrument for social change in the 21st century, through an annual program of innovative contemporary art exhibitions and an events program comprised of performances, salon-style discussions, and those organized by external partners.  aThis performance is a staged reading of Rehan Ansari's play Unburdened. A Canadian journalist travels to Karachi, Pakistan where he confronts the ongoing Indo-Pakistani conflict. The play takes place just before President Barack Obama's inauguration. The main character, Robin, realizes the impossible task of understanding and communicating what it really means to live inside a war zone. He reflects on our collective tendency to oversimplify the stakes of war, often distilling a conflict down to the binary of good and evil. He explores the "enemy's" point of view as a valid one: "There is a war; we are fighting it, that’s what you say. We are on your side so we are fighting it for the right reasons… Right?! ". The play also interrogates extremism as a sociopolitical construct, delving into the ease and speed with which certain groups embrace ideologies that ultimately lead to military conlficts. Unburdened threads a personal narrative of a couple's intimacy with shameful secrets and a complex past, all while telling of a journey that reveals the multifaceted violence of war.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

As the performances progresses, a set of walls in the shape of the same symbol are assembled around him by two White men, both from the United States. Standing atop the symbol for White supremacy and Nazism, Martiel suggests that those ideologies are foundational to the structures built around, under, and atop him. With his nude Black body at the center, Martiel depicts the corporeal, lived realities of Black people diasporically and globally, all subjected to the oppressions of constructions and ideologies with White supremacy at their core. At the end of the performance, the White men have finished the maze and have exited the performance space, leaving Martiel within the construct he had no hand in making.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Accompanied by a vampire Mariachi singer who only seeks American blood, Maravilla resignifies the meaning of each of these love songs. Instead of referencing a romantic partner, Guadalupe focuses on those killed or disappeared while crossing and those left on either side of the U.S. border.  aIn 1984, at eight years old, Guadalupe Maravilla immigrated alone to the United States from El Salvador in order to escape the Salvadoran Civil War. As an artist, Maravilla creates fictionalized performances, videos, sculptures and drawings that incorporate his pre-colonial Central American ancestry, personal mythology, and autobiography. Through his multidisciplinary studio practice, Maravilla traces the history of his displacement, interrogates the parallels between pre-Columbian cultures and our border politics. He has performed and presented his work extensively in venues such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, ICA Miami, Queens Museum, Bronx Museum, El Museo Del Barrio, MARTE (El Salvador), and more.The 8th Floor, founded in 2010 by Shelley and Donald Rubin, is an exhibition and performance space that promotes independent artistic and cultural initiatives.

Through his singing, and accompanied by pop ballad arrangements, he embodies a drag persona and explores different accents and dialects by manipulating pre-recorded voices. The performance features satirical, often absurd, and provocative lyrics centered around traditional constructs of gender and love, particularly amongst LGBTQ people. Sometimes pushing the exaggeration or absurdity of LGBTQ stereotypes, Linzy seeks to reinterpret and ultimately empower those so often questioned regarding their gender and/or sexuality.  aKalup Linzy is a video and performance artist based in Brooklyn, New York. Born in Stuckey, Florida. Linzy received his MFA from the University of South Florida. He also attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. Linzy has been the recipient of numerous awards including a grant from the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship, Creative Capital Foundation grant, a Jerome Foundation Fellowship, an Art Matters Grant, The Headlands Center for the Arts Alumni Awards Residency, and most recently a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Film and Video.

She began making these videos and photo/text works in the early 1970s while in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and further developed her performative and video-based practice after moving in 1974 to New York City, embarking on a long career that would see her gain attention across the U.S. for her provocative appearances and works. In 1976, she founded and continues to direct Franklin Furnace, an artist-run space that champions the exploration, promotion and preservation of artists’ books, installation art, video, online and performance art, further challenging institutional norms, the roles artists play within society, and expectations about what constitutes acceptable art mediums.The 8th Floor, founded in 2010 by Shelley and Donald Rubin, is an exhibition and performance space that promotes independent artistic and cultural initiatives.

Recent awards include residencies and fellowships with Hedgebrook, LMCC Process Space, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, and the Bogliasco Study Center in Italy. They are currently an Assistant Professor at UC Riverside and the founder/artistic director of The NWA Project.Kiyan Williams is a multidisciplinary artist and writer whose work explores Black queer identity. They create performances, texts, objects, images, sounds, and installations informed by autoethnography, archival research, and social practice. Williams’ performance is based on their ongoing research in Marlon Riggs' archives at Stanford University. You can learn more about their work at kiyanwilliams.com.Tavia Nyong’o is Professor of African American Studies, American Studies, and Theater Studies at Yale University. His research and teaching interests include black queer studies, and the legacy of pioneering black queer artists and activists such as Assotto Saint, Essex Hemphill, and Marlon Riggs. His first book The Amalgamation Waltz: Race, Performance, and the Ruses of Memory (Minnesota, 2009) won the Errol Hill Award for best book in African American theatre and performance studies.

The cinematic work, directed by Marlon Riggs, is a landmark piece of the LGBTQ community in portraying the community's complex relationship with HIV/AIDS. Kiyan Williams performed "Reflections in BlaQ" using Black queer and trans archival materials, primarily writings and films, as a method of dialogue between Riggs' work, the future of LGTB and Black rights activism, and the value of the archive as a political tool for change. Ni'Ja Whitson exhibited excerpts of  "A Meditation on Tongues," an adaptation of Riggs' film "Tongues Untied," performed in a live interdisciplinary setting (excerpts performed by The NWA Project - Ni'Ja Whitson and Kirsten Flores-Davis). After this homage to Riggs' work and the 25th anniversary of "Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien (No Regret)" release, Williams and Whitson hold a conversation moderated by Tavia Nyong'o, touching on topics such as the whitewashing of the HIV/AIDS narrative, gender, and the role of performance in fighting the omission of people of color's stories in the narrative of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Grullón has participated in residencies in the United States, South Korea, and Germany, and has presented workshops as part of the 2017 Whitney Biennial with Occupy Museums, Creative Time Summit '15, and The Royal College of Art, among others.  aThe Rule is Love #4 (with the gaze and no object), 2018 was a part of "Radical Women: Latin America" at The Brooklyn Museum. Unable to see or speak, Alicia Grullón was bound by rope while two performers wearing bear masks pulled her down to the floor. The performer's one rule was to keep getting up. The audience’s rule was to dance with her in order to prevent the bears from pulling her down. Layered into the performance were aspects of the historical formation of the gaze within museums where people of color were treated like carnival side shows on display.

Filibuster was a complete reenactment of the 11-hour filibuster by Texas State Senator Wendy Davis against a restrictive abortion bill. With this performance, Grullón reflected on the platforms provided to the empowered while also referring to a key women’s rights issue.

In his filibuster, Senator Sanders touches on ideas regarding class, the economy, and the history of capitalism.

(2018), artist Alicia Grullón reads from a document for a period of 8 hourse while collaborator Antonia Pérez crochets a garment around Grullón until she is no longer visible. The document is comprised of various articles Grullón had compiled on the history of the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, where the gallery/Essex Market is located. From Wikipedia articles to real estate listings, the collaged document details the neighborhood's histories from the Lenape tribe, the original inhabitants of Manahatta or Turtle Island, to the Wall Street slave auction, to Essex Crossings apartment listings. She also details the histories of working class and poor Irish/Italian/Jewish immigrants to the first wave of gentrification in the 1950s, to La Casita and community gardens, and the present landscape of the area. In preparation for the piece, Grullón studied the patrons of Essex Market and assumed the clothing style of older, mostly Latinx women, choosing to don a typical laundry cart with her during the performance, carrying produce such as plátanos and maduros. From Market To...  was part of Cuchifritos Gallery's exhibition "Whose Language Does the Produce Speak?" which activated the gallery's location within the Essex Market.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

In the midst of these changes, Grullón has also witnessed people organize, resist, and create. Her work as an artist presses into these issues of space, presence, and acts of resistance. By coming into Chelsea, Grullon talked to long-time residents of the neighborhood who have experienced all of its changes. Working with the Hudson Guild and senior programs at Penn South, she met with a group of residents, all within a three block radius. In this performance footage, Grullón takes on the personas of various Chelsea inhabitants with whom she spoke as a way of marking their continued presence in the neighborhood and the importance of their histories as part of Chelsea's, and New York's, collective memory.  pMedia source original: a1 digital file  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Founded in 1973, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe began as a living room salon in the East Village apartment of writer and poet Miguel Algarín, along with other playwrights, poets, and musicians of color whose work was not accepted by the mainstream academic, entertainment or publishing industries. As time passed, the signature style of performance poetry became a central fixture of urban Latino and African-American culture, leading to the purchase of a former tenement building at 236 East 3rd Street, where the Cafe continues to reside. A historical and cultural landmark for nearly 50 years, the Cafe has launched numerous careers and supports a wide range of artistic endeavors such as plays, workshops, training sessions, and more.  aThis video features footage of the opening percussion musical set at the Nuyorican Cafe in the mid-late 1970s. Featuring musicians from the Lower East Side, in the early days of the cafe, Caribbean and Afrodiasporic percussions were part of the opening rituals of the salons. The second part of the footage shows a bilingual workshop offered at the cafe primarily for educators. The participants engage in exercises in which they discuss their feelings about what makes them happiest and also discuss strategies for best resolving conflict and getting their students to explore their own interiorities.  pMedia source original: a1 EIAJ-1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

Often beginning and ending with live musical stylings from native Lower East Siders, this footage opens with a musical set by ABC Loisaida (A Band Called Loisaida), before featuring an introduction by Miguel Algarín. Nuyorican founding poet Jorge Brandon follows, then Tisi Garcia. Other poet performers include Miguel or Mikey Scolnick, poet and playwright Carlos Morton, Noel Rico, and Luis Guzmán, who goes ton to become a noted film actor. Each of the performers touches on themes of cultural heritage and pride, critiquing systems of colonialization, and the power of poetry as a tool of revolution. After the poems conclude, the band closes out the gathering with another musical set.  pMedia source original: a4 EIAJ-1  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.

The performance opens with a percussionist playing tabala drums, followed by Jaime, who sweeps the stage. As the performance unfolds, the theme of contradictions become apparent: Jaime's message about racism against and within Latinx populations, gendered and domestic labor carried out by a gender non-conforming body, issues of acceptance and desire, and more. Written in the years directly following the September 11th attacks, Jaime also explores the pervasive culture of fear, xenophobia, and blind patriotism, particularly in New York City. This work in progress showing took place the evening before President George W. Bush announced the War on Iraq.  aThe Nuyorican Poets Cafe Founders Archive Project is an effort of several Cafe founders to preserve the immense history of the famed cafe and to cement its importance as a foundational scene of poetry and artistic creation in New York's Lower East Side or Loisaida.

As time passed, the signature style of performance poetry became a central fixture of urban Latino and African-American culture, leading to the purchase of a former tenement building at 236 East 3rd Street, where the Cafe continues to reside. A historical and cultural landmark for nearly 50 years, the Cafe has launched numerous careers and supports a wide range of artistic endeavors such as plays, workshops, training sessions, and more.  pMedia source original: a1 Hi8  aThere are copyright restrictions on this collection.
