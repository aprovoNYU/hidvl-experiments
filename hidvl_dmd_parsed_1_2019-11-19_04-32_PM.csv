Not only are fundamentalists on the rise but also many competing brands of spirituality are now widely disseminated through media, film, best selling fiction and television. While most orthodox religions have always used ritual and performance, telecommunications and televisual effects are transforming religion into religiosity. ‘The return of religion’ has become an issue. Jean Franco is currently Professor Emeritus at Columbia University. She is the winner of the PEN 1996 award for lifetime contribution to the dissemination of Latin American literature in English and has been recognized by the Chilean and Venezuelan governments for advanced scholarship on Latin American literature in the United States.",English,"Franco, Jean| Religion and Telecommunications| Return of Religion| Hemispheric Institute| Spectacles of Religiosities",,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

In the installation/performance space of ‘Sans Gravity’, Bustamante explores the metaphors associated with water in the physical realm by burdening her body. The weight and the movement of the water develop into extensions of the gesture and another layer of the distorted self. The audience becomes a mechanism of relief. Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Her collaborations include working with such luminaries as Coco Fusco and Osseus Labrint. In 2001 she received the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman fellowship. Currently she is living in Troy, New York and an assistant professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.",English,"Bustamante, Nao| Performance art| Endurance art| Hemispheric Institute| Spectacles of Religiosities",Performance | Performance art| Endurance art,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

An invention that resists titles like Performance Artist, Man of God, or Anarchist -- Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping have become popular as none of the above or as all three. In one form, this project is an interactive play, an evening-length church service that seems to evolve from comedy to some sort of secular spirituality that downtown New York hipsters embrace. Working in 300-seat theaters with large gospel choirs that sing anti-consumerist lyrics (‘Stop Shopping! Stop Shopping! Now we can leave the Shopping Malls!’), the Reverend usually works, like a normal church, with a theme at each service. These range from anti-sweatshop concerns, to the neighborhood defense against the economy of tourism, to animal rights. However, Reverend Billy is best known for his Disney and Starbucks store invasions, which also combine the elements of drama, religion and politics.

A multi-media performance installation piece the artists create a participatory performance, inviting the audience to the ‘stage’, the entire gallery space. Using force and props like scissors, a pick axe and football equipment, at times physically violent, the two portray a scene relating to borders, migration and the process of globalization. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists.  It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.  As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ‘ephemeral communities’ of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier.  These are radical acts.","English, Spanish","Pocha Nostra| Gómez-Peña, Guillermo| Globalization & performance art| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere",Performance| Performance art| Performance/Installation| Political performance| Border art,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

As an actor, playwright and teacher, Anna Deavere Smith has built a remarkably wide-ranging and respected career.  Ms. Smith--whose work explores the American character and our multifaceted national identity--has been acclaimed by the media, critics and audiences across the country. The Macarthur Foundation awarded Ms. Smith a prestigious fellowship in 1996, saying she ‘has created a new form of theater --a blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism and intimate reverie.’ Looking at controversial events from multiple points of view, Ms. Smith's work combines the journalistic technique of interviewing her subjects with the art of interpreting their words through her performance.

As an actor, playwright and teacher, Anna Deavere Smith has built a remarkably wide-ranging and respected career.  Ms. Smith--whose work explores the American character and our multifaceted national identity--has been acclaimed by the media, critics and audiences across the country. The Macarthur Foundation awarded Ms. Smith a prestigious fellowship in 1996, saying she ‘has created a new form of theater --a blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism and intimate reverie.’ Looking at controversial events from multiple points of view, Ms. Smith's work combines the journalistic technique of interviewing her subjects with the art of interpreting their words through her performance.

She is a lovelorn and timeworn artiste, a singer of torch songs, a faded night club entertainer. She is a convicted murderer serving the last days of her sentence at Oso Blanco penitentiary. She is also, biologically speaking, a male. The writer dispenses with pieties on this issue — Loca’s biology is not a scandal but a fact. Loca disputes the notion that an aging male body is no home for a lady. She is vulgar, sentimental, sweet, and always sharp as a tack. She remains loyal to the memory of her beloved Nene Lindo, his brand of tough love, and his inscrutable beauty. Her crime binds them forever in shame and passion.’ Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org). , founded in 1979 in New York City, is dedicated to creating innovative and challenging theater rooted in Puerto Rican traditions and popular artistic expressions.

The piece was written in particular response to the U.S. ‘war on terror’ and the build-up to what we now know of the Iraq war of 2003. This performance brigs to the forefront a reflection on six aspects of the War on Terror: the destruction of a cosmic order; a fourth world war in a neo-prehistoric era; a political war in the global village; a genetic revolution; a gender war; and a cultural war. The performance combines multi-media sets with traditional opera from Orozco, music from Felipe and political satire from Rodríguez. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist, Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. She and her partner, Argentine singer/actor Liliana Felipe, own and operate El Hábito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. They have won an Obie for Best Actor in ‘Las Horas de Belén, A Book of Hours’ (1999) with Ruth Maleczech and New York-based Mabou Mines.

Based on Luis Enríquez & Sergio Bardotti’s ‘Los Saltimbanquis’ and the Brothers Grimm’s classic fairy tale ‘The Town Musicians of Bremen,’ the performance tells the story of the journey of four musician animals from four different regions of Peru: an Afro-Peruvian hen ('La Plumosa'), a donkey from the Southern plains ('El Burro'), a cat from the rainforest region ('La Michicha'), and a dog from the Northern coastal area ('El Chusco'). The animals abandon their hometowns in search of their dreams in the capital city; upon meeting each other along the way, and after many adventures and exploits, they decide to form a music group, the ‘Músicos Ambulantes’ (‘Traveling Musicians’), and to tour the country telling their multiethnic story. The resulting performance, by now a classic piece in Yuyachkani’s repertoire (performed since 1983), is a popular musical theater celebration of Peruvian cultural and ethnic diversity. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theatre,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy.

The performance aims to illustrate the contradictory aspects of mestizaje in which the genocide and rape of one race led to the creation of a new race. Furthermore, it looks to redefine mestizaje to incorporate mixed race and queer identities, portraying subversive yet fluid identities to dismantle the binaries created by colonial constructs relating to race and gender. Theories of contact between ancient civilizations and extraterrestrials influenced the performance artist's vision of a cosmic mestizaje in which the impending transformation of the world as we know it may lead to possibilities for the creation of a new existence and way of being. Gigi Otálvaro-Hormillosa, also known as the Devil Bunny in Bondage, is a San Francisco based interdisciplinary performance artist, video artist, cultural activist, curator and percussionist of Filipino and Colombian descent. She is originally from Miami, Florida and received her B.A. from Brown University where she created an independent concentration entitled 'Hybridity and Performance.'

An awakening call to the body led by, and oppressed by, globalization. Fabião explains, ‘The experience of being a ‘world citizen’ in the era of globalization produces on me, among many advantages and benefits, a disturbing vertigo, a certain existential dizziness.   I am permanently experiencing a tension provoked by the expansion of my body through all communication and transportation systems, and the dispersion of my self while perceiving the vast-virtual world’s web.  There is a centrifugal force expanding the body towards space and time, and a centripetal force condensing body and space in a timeless state. ‘Giro Piece’ is a performance art work that investigates these issues using maps (all kinds: sky maps, world maps, human body maps, subway maps…),four televisions, saliva, a dress, a woman-performer and the spectators’ presence and movement.’ Performance artist and theorist Eleonora Fabião focuses strongly on the relationship between the audience and performer, using ‘co-labor-a(c)tion’ to break down the standard active-passive dichotomy. The main thrust of her work is directed towards an exploration of the ‘poetic body’ and its creative, political and communicative abilities.",English,"Fabião, Eleonora| Performance art| Globalization and the body| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere",Performance| Performance art| Performance / Installation,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.",Spanish,"Correa, Ana| Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani| Cultural performance Peru| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere",,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

In a direct comment on the Americanmusical 'Evita,' Rodríguez proposes an 'alternative' history of Duarte dePerón's final days and the ultimate disposal of her corpse, playfullyclashing historic, real, fictional, virtual and anachronistic conceptionsof time and place.  'In the face of Latin America's current social,economic, and political crisis, in an era of globalization and profoundimpasses, we can't help but ask ourselves a pressing question: who was EvaPerón, and what happened to her corpse?': a satiric comment on Westernsociety's priorities, meshed with original and traditional tangos andmilongas (performed by 'el Gaucho del Wonder Bra' Liliana Felipe), thesequestions articulate the piece as a set of three interconnected skits.  Theperformance starts with a radio show featuring biographies of key femalepublic figures in Latin America (sponsored by 'Jabón Radical' ('RadicalSoap,' which 'cleans and reestablishes social order').  The second segmentis the enacted story of the 'final events' in Evita's life: Eva (performedby Rodríguez) bought a radio station to counteract her detractors' versionsof her life and death, and 'reenacts' her final days with the aid of her mother(who is about to give birth to President Carlos Menem, and wants to get theaccess code to Evita's bank accounts), a nurse, and a foley assistant.  Thethird and final skit takes us to a Mexico City's Customs office, wherecorruption, drug dealing, and political coups brew, resulting in a changeof government that intends to use Evita's body (held in customs on its wayto the U.S., where Madonna intended to use it as a promotional object forher movie) as sorts of flag for the 'incorruptibility' of the new 'nationalbody.'

Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.546 bb $a Spanish653 bb $a Rodríguez, Jesusa653 bb $a Felipe, Liliana653 bb $a El Hábito653 bb $a Chinga653 bb $a Mexico Politics and government655 b0 $a Performance655 b0 $a Cabaret655 b0 $a Popular theater655 b0 $a Political performance655 b0 $a Satire655 b0 $a Pastorela / Nativity playRIGHTS HOLDER INFORMATION: Jesusa Rodríguez & Liliana Felipe"

It intends to explore, recuperate and document the corporeal, vocal andmusical characteristics of Mexico's popular archetypes present in thecollective imagery and rooted in the tradition of satiric lithography asdeveloped at the end of the XIX century by artists like José MaríaVillasana, Daniel Cabrera, José Guadalupe Posada and Constantino Escalante,among others.  The result, a sorts of Mexican Commedia dell'Arte -withimprovisational twists and turns aiming to evidence vices in socialconduct- is less an archaeological 'reconstruction' than a humorous,satiric reenactment and actualization of these archetypes in the context ofcurrent sociopolitical events in the public sphere.  Some archetypicalcharacters -depicted in masks created by Sheila Goloborotko- are: 'El Hijodel Ahuizote' (the persecuted and censored journalist), 'Doña CaralampiaMondongo' (the spirit of criticism), 'Don Catrín de la Fachenda' (thepretentious deceiver),  'La Jamona' (the socialite old maid, stalker ofyoung men), 'El Dictador' (the figure of power and authoritarism), 'ElPadre Cobos' (the anticlericalist), 'El Maromero' (the exploitativepolitician who, no matter what, is always back on his feet), 'El Lépero'(the eternal underdog, the moral contagium), 'El Pulque' (the folkloricembodiment of inspiration), 'El Pelado' (the builder of the nation), 'LaChina' (the brave townswoman), and 'El Cuico' (the roguish policeman).

In 'a land far, faraway, in a big city affected by the citizens' carelessness, but that thanks to thegovernment... was totally devastated,' a little girl with an 'uncanny'resemblance to President Salinas meets a vagabond who gives her terriblenews: a dangerous giant ('a subproduct of civil indignation for electoralfraud') approaches the city intending to rebel from the abuses ofpolitical tyranny. The giant indeed arrives, and destroys the public garden (for which the girlcalls him 'selfish'). He is then approached by villains Fanfarrón andEscaldufa (the latter a witch, here impersonating the United States), who intend torender him 'politically unconscious' and make him an ally in their agendaof destruction. Cachirulo helps the girl look for a magic elixir that can counter the villains' evil influence. With theaid of three magic talismans, they dodge the villains' repeated attacks, butEscaldufa ultimately outsmarts them by dressing up like 'the NAFTA fairy.'She proposes the girl to barter the control of all the hemisphere inexchange for an elixir that erases any political 'mishandling.' Sealed theagreement, the girl makes a public speech promising to magically transformMexico into a First World country, but instead wishes for hair and pours theelixir over her bald head, emptying the bottle in the process. With nomore elixir to transform the country, the girl resorts to the argument that 'itis not with exotic formulas that the country will improve, we requirepatience, strength, unity.' Cachirulo, indignant, interrupts the political speech,silencing the girl and ending the story.

Mayo describes ‘‘Voices,’ as being a piece about the different parts of our lives that criss-cross and sometimes requires healing.’ The performance is based on her personal experiences of being a part of a family that belonged to two different Native nations and her attempts to make herself whole. With ‘Voices,’ Mayo conveys the need for Indian Country to ‘mend the cracks’ caused by familial fractures—and often the cause of conflict within families, communities and between nations. The performance eventually became ‘Daughters from the Stars,’ featuring Spiderwoman Theater. Lisa Mayo, (Kuna/Rappahannock) was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.   Mayo is co-founder of Spiderwoman Theater, which is the longest running Native women's theater troupe in the country.

The male dancers are Louis Mofsie (Hopi/Winnebago) and Michael Taylor (Delaware).

The siblings are members of the Nakota Nation and grew up on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie.  Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.  Today, the Thunderbird’s annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences.

Dr. Venables' lecture discusses the cultural differences between European and Indian concepts of land and land ownership.  These differences, coupled with the illegal and unjust taking of Indian land have over the years led to many Indian land claims against the United States government. In 1946 Congress created the Indian Land Claims Commission to adjudicate the overwhelming number of cases Indians had filed and were continuing to file. By the time the commission expired thirty-three years later more than a half billion dollars had been awarded.  Nevertheless many cases remain pending and many others have yet to be filed.   Dr. Venables explains this complicated history and examines both the historical and contemporary issues and the legal relationship between the tribes and U.S. government.  Although the primary focus is on the Haudenausaunee (Iroquois) his talk includes issues concerning all tribes specifically, citizenship, Indian-to-Indian relationships, and the government's relationship with the tribes today.

The group was started with the intention of using traditional methods of Native culture as a means to educate through song and dance. The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie.  Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.  Today, the Thunderbird’s annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences. Specializing in a variety of distinct regional tribal dances, their performances are wonderfully presented with narrative stories. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs.

The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.",English,"American Indian Community House| Farris, Phoebe | Agard, Nadema| Akers, Norman| Contemporary Native American artists",,,American Indian Community House

Cánepa befriends a ‘Qolla’ (a comic Andean dancer), who lends him his body and his voice so that he could tell his story. The play is performed around a platform that supports pieces of clothing, according to the Andean custom that lays them in wake, eight days after the death of a relative, as a final farewell ritual. During the years of political terror of Peru’s Dirty War this ritual has been transformed as the only way to bid farewell to the souls of the departed when their bodies have been disappeared by the military.

The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy.

In this play, a series of characters of diverse backgrounds live together in a project in the middle of the city, from which they are soon to be evicted. Even though they are neighbors facing a common fate, the characters await isolated from one another instead of forging a network of solidarity in the face of the eviction. Each life story is told and retold individually, recreated by physical actions in a reiterative play that evidences the profound and painful dissociation between word and action in these characters’ lives.

The performers, characters Abelardo and Amanda, try to recapture their act, their identities, their audience and a grip on life. Rising from the mists of death, or perhaps from hell, the performers --he amid racks of drums and cymbals and she in a wheelchair -- try to recover speech, coordination, a sense of each other, passion, even sex, but they never quite connect.

Due to the war, these three caretakers—the only survivors of the town—have been unable to honor their patron saint for many years. For the Hispanic Mayordomo and his mestiza employee, Bernardina, the procession would restore order and bring meaning back to their lives. Yet, for the subaltern indigenous character, Rufino, to honor Santiago would betray his cultural identity. Rufino thus decides to adopt the language, masks, and clothes of an Andean trickster deity in order to betray the attempt to restage the procession. As the program notes explain, during la Reconquista the figure of Santiago was transformed from a peaceful follower of Christ into the Moor-slaying Patron of Spain; in the Conquest, he became a killer of Indians. Ironically, Catholicism's colonizing force turned Santiago into the holy patron of many Peruvian towns, venerated by the largely native and mestizo population. This production suggests that, although forgotten by most Peruvians, a syncretic connection between Santiago and the Andean god Yllapa motivated this odd veneration. The piece merges dream with reality, past with present, as the memories of the earlier peninsular Reconquest allegorize both the Spanish Conquest of America and the recent guerilla war that ravaged the country for decades.

The play is weaved around two words: Love and Utopia --be it the Utopia of Love or the Love for Utopia. A long-time couple kills time by putting themselves in extreme situations in order to overcome boredom and safeguard their love. They leave home and wander from run-down hotel to run-down hotel, confronting every day as if it was their very first. This piece is an exploration on the world of romantic couples, an investigation on love, encounters and disencounters, communication and miscommunication, presence and absence. Far from portraying a linear storyline, it shows a broad spectrum of sensations and relationships for and with the spectators, so that it is them who ultimately piece together the elements at play through the lens of their own experiences and references regarding love, human relations, solitude, solidarity, disenchantment and hope.

One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’,CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as anessential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning thepractices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as anecessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance betweenthe artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open andspontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everydaylife’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of thedaily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion thatdecontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locationsand signs. On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milkfactory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previouslyplanned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where thetrucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connectsa milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. Thisconnection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum bycovering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought toexpose political violence, cultural censorship, and human misery in acountry threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’sdictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so themilk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology andPinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist politicalrepression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk plant packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of parked trucks in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. The artists at its front door spread a large white cloth in order to cover the entrance.

CADA invited Chilean artists from different fields to spread thismessage on walls all over Santiago. The slogan was soon used by differentcollectives all over the country as a massive public symbol of politicalresistance and non-conformity. This documentary shows a series ofinterviews with Chilean intellectuals reflecting on the centrality of CADAfor the resistance to the Pinochet dictatorship. The interviewees (MilanIvelic, Nelly Richard, José Joaquín Brunner and Eugenia Brito) talkabout the rupturist character of CADA vis-à-vis the Chilean artestablishment, posing an interpenetration of art, politics and socialcritique in their work, and branding CADA as fundamental to the developmentof a field of political resistance and critical thinking among intellectuals.",Spanish,Colectivo Acciones de Arte (CADA)| No +| Dictatorship Chile -Augusto Pinochet| Art and politics| Civil rights activism,Documentary| Interview| Political performance| Activism Chile,,CADA (Colectivo Acciones de Arte)

On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milkfactory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previouslyplanned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where thetrucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connectsa milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. Thisconnection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum bycovering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought toexpose political violence, cultural censorship and human misery in acountry threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’sdictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so themilk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology andPinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist politicalrepression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk factory packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city.

Fulana used The Virgin of Guadalupe to comment on the commodification of religion, as her image is everywhere: on t-shirts, postcards, key chains, handbags, designer jeans, etc.; she has become a hipster-friendly Latina Virgin superstar. Juan Diego, the indigenous man to whom this Virgin first appeared, has recently made it to sainthood, but he has been 'whitened' in the Vatican's official image, which erases his indigenous traits and makes him look like a Spaniard. This is reminiscent of the whitening of Latina/o pop stars when they 'make it' in the music industry ( e.g. Shakira). Rewriting J-Lo's pop hit, 'Jenny from the Block,' this video stages the 'creation' of Saint Juan Diego by mafia-sounding Vatican intelligence (the Pope and music producer Emilio Estefan). Knowing the Catholic Church is in crisis, losing many of their flock to Evangelicals, they decide to canonize Juan Diego to attract the Latino market. Mr. Estefan gives Juan Diego a 'cross-over make-over' and the Pope canonizes him on the spot. JuanDi is thrilled by his transformation, but the Virgin admonishes him for having sold out. As the song progresses, their fighting becomes more intense, their egos take over, and they eventually alienate their supporters, who go off with an Evangelical couple who knocks at their door.

In this interview, conducted in the context of the celebration of the International Women's Day, Peirano, Correa and Ralli discuss the role of women in Peruvian theater. Topics covered include women’s role in society, the difficulty of making a living as professional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists’work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection about these roles, a creative realm where to play with and challenge them.  For Ralli and Correa, theater has been a space for personal growth, aesthetic exploration, and social intervention.  The artists discuss the interplay between their workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issues of sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances, and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internal workings of Yuyachkani and with their audience.  This program includes clips from ‘La Primera Cena’ (one of Yuyachkani’s plays) and the Encuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought together various Peruvian femaleperformers of Peru). Teresa Ralli also discusses her role in Yuyachkani’s play ‘Músicos Ambulantes,’ and the role women artists play in the creation and performance of her piece ‘Antígona.’ Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.",Spanish,"Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani| Women, theater and performance| Women performing artists| Women Peru| Theater Peru",,,Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani

Teresa demonstrates that bodytraining stresses body memory, composition and accumulation.  In terms ofvoicework, Ralli discusses the need to find an 'organic' voice and theimportance of vocal interpretation; she also demonstrates the importance ofbreath in voicework.  Ms. Ralli believes actors must give the voice a task, ause of the text, and should take the voice out of its 'normal space.' To demonstrate the leap from ordinary to extra-ordinary uses of voice and text, the artist imitates popular Peruvian chants such as slogans commonly used by streetvendors; in this demonstration, Ralli switches languages, from English to Spanish to Quechua (anindigenous language of Peru which is rarely spoken by people from outside indigenous communities, but has been consistently incorporated in Yuyachkani’s work, turning into one ofthe ensemble's distinguishing elements). This pedagogical demonstration also includes object manipulation work, including exercises that explorethe weight, balance and center of diverse objects.  In order to illustrate herresearch on the subject, Ralli includes a demonstration of her work withchairs, which is a fundamental part of the Yuyachkani technique inobject-work.  Finally, the artist shows the audience some aspects ofcharacter development, demonstrating diverse stages in the creation of oneof her characters, ‘El Chusco,' featured in ‘MúsicosAmbulantes,’ a musical spectacle created by Yuyachkani in 1983 andstill performed today.  Weight, balance, volume, flows of energy andcenters of balance, showcased in this demonstration, are central aspects inYuyachkani’s (re)search of what they term an ‘actor múltiple’ or‘multiple actor,’ a performer who explores and embodies the interplay between technique and sensitive/bodily memory. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000.

After the fall of the Fujimori Presidency in 2001, theextent of governmental corruption and its key players were being exposed, by means of documentation which demonstrated that members of Fujimori’s Cabinet hadaccepted bribes, in addition to embezzling a great amount of money duringhis presidency.  In this street action, members of Yuyachkani perform acritique to the abuses of power and the financial corruption that tookplace within Fujimori's government: the actors dance to the well-known ‘El bailedel Chino’ (a ‘tecnocumbia’ song used by Fujimori for his thirdelectoral campaign), wearing masks to represent some of these politicalfigures, including Fujimori, Montesinos, the Mayor, the Minister, aCongresswoman, a representative of Judicial Power, the Assessor, Owners ofMass-Communication, the Military and the Grupo Colina (a paramilitarygroup).  The group toured around Lima in a small bus which they called‘El Bus de la Fuga’ (‘Escape Bus’), from Barrios Altos (a neighborhood that suffered the murder to some of its residents) to La Cantuta (where a number of studentswere murdered) to Tokyo (where President Fujimori fled to exile).  Theroute covered both affluent and impoverished neighborhoods of Peru’s capital city-including the Palacio de Justicia, the Distrito de Comas, the ParqueUniversitario, the Universidad Nacional de Educación, Ate-Vitarte, Villael Salvador, and Miraflores- eliciting the most varied reactions dependingon where the street action was performed.

Three friends meet upto cook and share a supper on the last day of the last year of the XXthcentury, honoring a pact made twenty years before.  Only two of theoriginal three friends arrive (the third, a militant worker for humanrights, has been murdered); in her place, her daughter (played by LuciaLora) arrives to honor the pact made by her mother.  All three women are indifferent stages in their lives.  The first character (played by AnaCorrea) was the top of her class in High School but, upon graduation, shequickly married and had five kids who are her entire life now.  The secondcharacter (played by Rebecca Ralli) realized her High School dreams bybecoming an artist, but stopped painting when she entered into a badmarriage ten years after graduation.  The third character, the daughter ofthe third friend, is resentful because, although her mother had time forthe rights of other children, she feels that she never had time for her. The three women revisit their lives and the moments they feel that changedthe course of their destiny.  They decide that this will be the firstsupper (‘la primera cena’) of their new lives.  In the middle ofdinner, the ‘Goddess of the Kitchen’ appears (in this play, the kitchenfunctions as a metaphor for life); the characters revalue the knowledge andwisdom of women (in the context of the space of the kitchen), ultimatelyinviting the audience to share their first supper with them by eating thesoup they were actually cooking on stage.

Correa believes thatthe body is an actor's instrument; in this pedagogical demonstration she focuses onher body work and her work with objects in the development of a character. Among the diverse elements of body work, Correa shows: the importance ofmoving the body through space in different ways and at different speeds;the importance of feeling your weight in the space; and how to make musical‘phrases’ with your body, and how to play with the timing of the phraseand manipulate it.  The demonstration also includes an example of how theactress incorporates Tai-chi into her character development – Tai chibeing an important methodology for exploring and developing bodilyexpressivity for Yuyachkani.  The lecture also includes mask work, as Anashows how the mask takes on its own identity, how the masked charactermoves, and how it responds to various objects.  Correa also discussesthe balance between text work and body work.  One of the elements of bodywork she demonstrates is dance, in particular the use of tap dance to learnhow to play with timing.  Ms. Correa goes over the creation of one of hercharacters, ‘Po Po’ the clown.  Part of her methodology for creatingthis character included playing with musical instruments (in the case of‘Po Po’, an accordion), not only as instruments per se but also as performingobjects; special attention is paid to the exploration of how toexpress emotions with and through them.

Inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus, Ariadneand the Minotaur, the play poses a philosophical reflection on the desires,repressions, dreams and sufferings of contemporary men and women.  Thetriangle Ariadne-Theseus-Phaedra (performed by Paloma Woolrich, Juan Ibarraand Claudia Lobo respectively), brings to the forefront dramatic conflictsrooted in a series of dualities: sensual/spiritual, constructive/destructive,idealist/pragmatic, male/female, to attack/to wait.  The performance, fullof poetic images, choreographic gestures, and mythic symbolism, renders theMinotaur a metaphor of these conflicts (the ‘inner monsters’ ofhumanity): each one of us, contemporary people, confronts our own innerMinotaur.

Presented as afairytale-gone-wrong (presented by Cachirulo, legendary children’s TVcharacter by Enrique Alonso, and ‘betwitched’ by Cachirulo’s TVcharacters Bruja Escaldufa and Fanfarrón), the piece poses ananti-Establishment take on the agrarian reforms proposed by then PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari (through his controversial Ammendment to Article27 of Mexico's Constitution). These reforms directly affected theorganizational units known as ‘ejidos’ –hence the Spanish pun between‘el ejido’ (‘the ejido’) and ‘elegido’ (‘the Chosen One’, aChristian epithet common in Nativity plays).  Corruption, embezzlement andpolitical violence roam rural Mexico while legendary political figures andfictional characters visit an impoverished, disempowered peasant couple. The constant abuses, endured patiently by the peasantry and indigenouspeoples, evidence how political promises of progress and of inclusion inthe ‘national project’ end up as nightmares of oppression for millionsof Mexicans through history.

Rodríguez populates the scenario of the ‘palenque’(‘cockpit’, a place for popular gambling games like cockfighting) withchameleonic characters Chona Schopenhauer (‘the only rancheraphilosopher’), Pita Amor (an old-fashioned, affected performer of poetry)and Don Andrés Soler (a very macho, politically conservative old man),among others, through which the artist criticizes the corruption and violenceassociated with Mexico’s political climate.  In a ‘phenomenology offortuitous becoming', the universe is portrayed as 'a palenque whereanything could happen’, and Mexican electoral processes as a 'gamble'.  Inthis vein, and interspersed with parodic renditions of traditional folksongs by Rodríguez and ‘sexy ranchera’ Isela Vega (a famous Mexicanvedette),  the audience is invited to play a satirical Mexican‘lotería’ (with cards like ‘The Wetback’, ‘The Zapatista’,‘The First Lady’, and ‘The ATM’ substituting the traditional iconsof this popular game) and to gamble, control, and judge an electoral‘cockfight’ where puppets of political candidates race to be the firstto reach the finishing line of Mexico's presidency. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation.

Michelson frames this issue within the larger subject of Nativedisplacement.  Another theme of his work is the landscape, which the artistuses to challenge the notions of supremacy and superiority.One of thepieces Alan concentrates on, ‘Two Row II,’ is a video installationwhich references the Two Row Wampum Belt that symbolizes the agreementunder which the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee (the Six nations confederacy whichMohawk are a part of) welcomed the white peoples to their lands: 'We willNOT be like father and son, but like brothers.

The discussion leads toEyre’s landmark film ‘Smoke Signals’ and the direction the success ofthe film took him personally and professionally.  The success of this filmlead the artist to a feeling of greater responsibility to represent and togain knowledge about other tribes since he became an involuntaryspokesperson for Native people. As a filmmaker at the beginning of his career, interviewer Andrew McLean(Inupik) directed several questions to Eyre about negotiating the filmworld as a minority producer. Chris acknowledged the existing pressures tobe ‘issue oriented’ and stated that the fact that a Native person wason film makes it a political piece.  Eyre reflects on some of his filmssuch as ‘Skins’ (which he made to illustrate the poverty on the PineRidge reservation, and consequently did not have a successful run), andcontrasted it with his character-driven films such as ‘Smoke Signals’and ‘Edge of America,’ which have a more universal appeal. FinallyChris relays Andrew, who come form a whaling Nation, his excitement aboutan upcoming project on the Makah Whale hunt that took place in May 17, 1999at Neah Bay.",English,"Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics| Eyre, Chris, | Native filmmakers| Smoke signals (Motion picture)| Indigenous performance",,,Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics

Issues of Latino and Latin American identity andsolidarity are discussed, as well as the limits and possibilities ofpolitical theater as a tool for aesthetic exploration and socialintervention.

The character represents the many women, at home or in theirworkplaces, which are living the anguish of waiting for their disappearedfamily members. We see the woman in her private space, as she performsmundane tasks; as the character attempts to stay engrossed in herhousework, traumatic memories of violent events -recorded in her body- arerepeated time and again. Lodged in her body, the scars of violence, death,and terror inevitably puncture every gesture, every task. When thecharacter does speak, it is a fragmented collage of commonplace phrasesmixed with texts from Rodoreda, Galeano, Borges, Vestrini, and actualtestimonies from the families of the disappeared. The actions of thecharacter rise above the silence and make us witnesses of a world plaguedby fear, where hope and courage are the unique materials of survival.Teatro La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women’s theater inColombia.

The theme of the ‘rehearsal’ ishair, legends of the long hair of ancestral feminine characters likeMedusa, Lady Godiva, Mary Magdalene, among others.  The piece questions thetradition of patriarchal thought which depicts women’s bodies asincarnations of evil; with the complicit help of science, religion, law,art and marketing, the symbolic damnation of women has been perpetuated,reinforced by new, contemporary myths.  The ambivalent depiction of thefeminine throughout history –as a muse, an object, a mother, a temptress,an angel, a witch- positions the feminine in a paradoxical crossroads ofmisogyny and idealization, rendering women a disempowered ‘Other’. Thepiece poses a feminist commentary on these misogynist practices, using ameta-theatrical approach to the stories of famous feminine icons todenounce the injustices inflicted on them, and to celebrate their power andagency as women. La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women’s theaterin Colombia.

The theme of the ‘rehearsal’ ishair, legends of the long hair of ancestral feminine characters likeMedusa, Lady Godiva, Mary Magdalene, among others.  The piece questions thetradition of patriarchal thought which depicts women’s bodies asincarnations of evil; with the complicit help of science, religion, law,art and marketing, the symbolic damnation of women has been perpetuated,reinforced by new, contemporary myths.  The ambivalent depiction of thefeminine throughout history –as a muse, an object, a mother, a temptress,an angel, a witch- positions the feminine in a paradoxical crossroads ofmisogyny and idealization, rendering women a disempowered ‘Other’. Thepiece poses a feminist commentary on these misogynist practices, using ameta-theatrical approach to the stories of famous feminine icons todenounce the injustices inflicted on them, and to celebrate their power andagency as women. La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women’s theaterin Colombia.

Overall, ‘Noticias de María’ poses a feministcritique to the women’s passive acceptance of a gendered ‘destiny’determined by a ‘machista’ society. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest-and one of the only- feminist, all-women’s theater in Colombia. Foundedin 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised ofmale as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the womenstayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, LucyBolaños decided to make La Máscara a women’s ensemble fully dedicatedto a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and socialchange, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social andeconomic pressures they’ve had to endure in an environment plagued byviolence and machismo, which constantly seeks to ‘invisibilize’ theirwork. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not onlycreating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities,actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and beinginvolved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, theykeep re-thinking women’s role in the construction of a peacefulColombia.546 bb $a Spanish653 bb $a Teatro La Máscara653 bb $a Gender and culture653 bb $a Feminism653 bb $a Feminist theater653 bb $a Theater Colombia655 b0 $a Performances655 b0 $a Theater655 b0 $a Feminist theaterRIGHTS HOLDER INFORMATION: Teatro La Máscara"

He isgoing to be beheaded but he does not know when. The prisoner is obsessedwith the date of his execution and asks every visitor about this.Everybody, including the warden, hides this information from him. Theprisoner is alternatively visited by the warden’s daughter, his ownmother, a new inmate, and by the warden; even a group of ghosts or visionshaunts him. Amidst the nightmarish, carnivalesque ebbs and flows ofvisitors, the protagonist acts as a deluded philosopher. He alternatesobsessive references to the date of his execution with deep (albeit weird)philosophical reflections. Faithful to their traditional exploration ofmarginal subjects, La Candelaria chooses as main character a trueanti-hero, an underdog trapped in the power games of society. La Candelariawas founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals whocame from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement.Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater’smost innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popularaudiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore,situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia’s mostcompelling plays, some of them through the method of ‘creacióncolectiva’ (collective creation), addressing the acute social andpolitical problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered thecreation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a numberof theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods andlanguages.

Speaking about his creativeprocess, García tells how he read the book over and over in search ofdramatic parts, trying to find events and adventures in the play that werenot well-known to the public. He found twelve scenes that interested himand started elaborating on them, working closely and experimentally withthe actors. He also comments on the work of Pedro Alcántara, the person incharge of the visual aspects of the play, to which Santiago García gives alot of importance. After García’s intervention, the tape shows differentscenes of the play. Humorous skits, the excerpts evidence how costumes,puppets and choreography play a crucial part in La Calendaria’s stagingof ‘El Quijote’. Santiago García then explains what the figure of ElQuijote means to him: he sees great powers of vision in Quijote’smadness.

The truthis it is a kind of no-place surrounded by violence and social conflicts.The characters constantly refer to issues from the outside as ifpolitical violence and other danger exist only outside, and the bar was ahaven. However, violence makes its way into the bar: two shady characters irrupt inthe bar’s status quo, forcefully involving the patrons, employees andpassers-by in their shady business. The people at the bar need to negotiatetheir complicity or resistance to the illegal activities performed by thetwo newcomers, who with their guns and money set an atmosphere of fear andviolence in an otherwise uneventful crossroad’s ‘cantina’.

When Patricia Ariza visited Urabá, a region in Colombia, shetalked to a group of women who could not bury their dead husbands, killedin the civil war. She connected this awful situation to the myth ofAntigone and read it to the collective. This version of La Candelariainvolves a series of transformations to the original myth. At thebeginning, we see Tiresias walking around an empty space; taking the placeof the chorus, he gives the audience the historical context, recountingbackground events that are important for a proper understanding of theplay. The play presents three Antigones and two Ismenes who discuss thepossibility of violating Creonte’s rules in order to bury their brothersaccording to tradition. The discussion is thus polyphonic. La Candelariawas founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals whocame from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement.Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater’smost innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popularaudiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore,situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia’s mostcompelling plays, some of them through the method of ‘creacióncolectiva’ (collective creation), addressing the acute social andpolitical problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered thecreation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a numberof theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods andlanguages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire,experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artisticcreation.",Spanish,"Teatro La Candelaria| Collective creation| García, Santiago| Theater Colombia| Antigone",Performances| Theater,,Teatro La Candelaria

A theater piece on memory, atrocity, affect andresistance, ‘Pulpos’ bridges time (from a mythical time to the ‘BabyBoomers’ to the ‘Generation X’), and place (with an Andean textrendered Caribbean, adapted to the Puerto Rican reality) in order todenounce political repression, police brutality, ideological persecutionand political assassination, and to evoke and pay homage to our dead anddisappeared. An organizing image is that of the ‘velorio’ or wake for alost child, (alluding to the canonical Puerto Rican painting by FranciscoOller and to a contemporary rendition by Rafael Trelles), in an explorationof memories of loss and a sense of community, of a broader Puerto Ricanfamily. The recurring motif of the sea shore opens productivelayers of signification, rhythm and spatial organization: it hints to thewaters where Argentineans were ‘disappeared’ during the dictatorship,the island of Puerto Rico's (geographic and political) borders, and to the Beatles' song ‘Octopus’ Garden’, which inspires thepiece’s title. The resulting performance is an open call to rescue andsafeguard collective memories of political and historical events that haveshaped our present Latin American societies. It is also an artistic attemptto capture and evoke the sensorial complexities of past events, claimingthem as genealogical landmarks in our current collective life.

Along withchoreographer Viveca Vázquez, she directs and administers the Taller deOtra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the development andproduction of experimental dance and performance projects. As a soloartist, she produces her work since 1991 through her organization‘Producciones Teresa, no Inc.’. She also offers workshops, talks andperformance demonstrations for high school and college students. Teresa’screative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing oftraditional artistic categories. An excellent example and exploration ofher experimental, alternative work is ‘Infarto’ (Heart Attack), wheretheater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement, costumes, video,animation, projections, music and everyday objects are juxtaposed andconfronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness areexplored and celebrated. Along with fellow experimental performers EduardoAlegría and Yamil Collazo, Teresa exposes the struggles, anxieties andexploits of being experimental artists in Puerto Rico. Forced migration,bigotry, lack of available spaces and proper funding, and the pressure todefine their work within fixed boundaries of traditional art forms all posea daily threat to artists, who metaphorically ‘infartan’ due to thesesocial, political and economic conditions. In turn, the artists celebrateprecariousness, the unpolished work of art, the slippery path betweendisciplines, embracing affect and humor to assert publicly that their workis ‘a different kind of performance’: ‘lo mío es otroteatro.’",Spanish,"Hernández, Teresa| Performing arts Puerto Rico| Women in the performing arts| Puerto Rico social conditions| Experimental artists Puerto Rico",Performances| Theater| Multimedia performance,,Teresa Hernández

Puerto Rico, a Caribbean islandstruggling with an authentic identity crisis, torn in the in-between zoneof an oblique colonialism, delusions of cosmopolitan aspirations sold bytourism advertisements, a half baked bilingualism, and self-inflictedbigotry, produces a ‘foreign movie’ which is at the same time a‘Puerto Rican film’. Spoken in a fictional pidgin, and subtitled inSpanish, it portrays a tragicomic Grand Reunion of individuals fixed onevading and denying the ‘Puerto Rican condition’ through theimpersonation of alternative citizenships and absurd allegiances. The videoart piece show subjects living in anachronism and escapism, surroundingthemselves in an artificial aura of the exotic that directly contrasts withthe everyday life in the island’s metropolitan area. The short film,shown as a stand-alone piece in film festivals locally and abroad, is alsoa building block of sorts, combined and recombined by Hernández in hermultimedia spectacles in order to explore and unveil the complex layers ofnegotiation and denial at play in issues of identity politics of ourpostmodern societies.",In Spanish (subtitles) and a fictional pidgin,"Hernández, Teresa| Performing arts Puerto Rico| Women in the performing arts| Puerto Rico social conditions| Identity politics",Performances| Video art| Short film| Experimental performing arts,,Teresa Hernández

This video documents their piece ‘It’s a Small House and We've Lived in it Always’. In it, two explorers lay claim to the same territory. With three chairs as its only props, little speech, some song and much meaningful movement and expressive acting, the piece shows longtime cohabitants engaged in a contest for space. These people have known each other for a long time. They occupy a house the size of a small stage, a house divided and subdivided by time and bad habits.  They sit on the porch, watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change.  Their only hope is an audience. As they move apart and then together, spurn advances and accept closeness, mime rejection and flirtation and reveal need, the two performers enact the ebb and flow of a universally resonant relationship. This work was first commissioned by the South Bank Center as part of theBritish Festival of Visual Theatre. This video documents its NY premiere at La Mama, in the context of the show ‘Double Agency’, the first collaboration between Split Britches and the renowned English troupe The Clod Ensemble.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.'

In 1981, it was adapted into a featurefilm for Universal Films. ‘Zoot Suit’ is based on the 1942 ‘SleepyLagoon’ murder mystery and the Zoot Suit Riots that occurred in LosAngeles after that.  The riots took place in the racially chargedenvironment of Los Angeles where sailors, soldiers and marines returningfrom World War II came into conflict with local Mexican zoot suiters. OnJune 3, 1943 a group of servicemen alleged they had been assaulted by agroup of Pachucos, Mexican American youth who had their own subcultureduring the 1930s and 40s in the American Southwest. They wore distinctiveclothing, such as zoot suits, and spoke a dialect, Calo, which isrepresented in this ETC production; they were often associated with gangactivity. A larger group of servicemen gathered in the center of theMexican community in Los Angeles where they attacked men wearing zootsuits. The police responded by arresting Mexican American youths, who hadbeen attacked in the riots, for disturbing the peace. ETC's ‘Zoot Suit’combines fact and fiction to show the fate of twenty-two Mexican Americans broughtto trial for a murder they did not commit. The character of Henry Reyna isbased upon real-life zoot suiter Henry Leyvas, who was tried and wrongfullyconvicted of first-degree murder of Jose Diaz in 1942 (the Sleepy Lagoonmurder). Reyna and his friends were set free in 194","English, Spanish and Calo","Teatro Campesino| Chicano theater| Zoot Suit Riots, California, | Leyvas, Henry| Pachucos",Performance| Theater,,El Teatro Campesino

The piece began as a five-week workshop in ETC's San JuanBautista playhouse in the summer of 1982, exploring the stories andnarrative lyrics of Mexican popular ballads or ‘corridos’. The workshopproduction was an instant popular success with audiences and critics. ETCdecided to stage a new production of ‘Corridos’ at the Marines MemorialTheater in San Francisco, where it ran for three months to great reviewsand eleven Bay Area Critics Awards. Other stagings followed in 1984.‘Corridos’ finally evolved into a full-fledged video production in1987, after several drafts of the script that not only reworked theselection of ballads, but also condensed the material to fit into theconfines of a one-hour special. The production presents two full-length‘corridos’: ‘Delgadina’ (a haunting parable of incest in a wealthyMexican family), and ‘Soldadera’ (based on the dispatches of Americanjournalist John Reed, in which the compelling story of Elizabeta is framedby three songs of women during the 1910 Mexican Revolution). Highlightsfrom other traditional ‘corridos’ are connected by engaging narrativesequences: ‘Yo soy El Corrido’ (the story of the ‘corrido’ itself),‘Rosita Alvirez’ (a comedic parable of a defiant young woman who meetsan early death), and ‘El Lavaplatos’ (the story of an immigrant whodreams of becoming a movie star and ends up a dishwasher). Joining membersof the original cast, the production included popular songstress LindaRonstadt, singer/actor Daniel Valdez, San Francisco Ballet artist EvelynCisneros, and actor Clancy Brown. All in all, ‘Corridos’ broke ground with a form of musical popular theater that made the transition from theater to television without losing its theatricality.

As part of anepic struggle to achieve victory in union elections among ranches up anddown the state, the campaign in Burlap brings together two brothers andpulls them apart.

The play was inspired by a 1984 newspaper article describing an86-year-old woman in Juarez, Mexico who was found to be carrying a60-year-old mummified fetus in her womb. Fifteen years later, playwright,director and founder of ETC Luis Valdez returned to the article whilesimultaneously embarking on a highly personal investigation of his ownfamily history. Valdez traveled to Sonora, Mexico to investigate hisfamily’s Yaqui roots and ancestral history; ‘Mummified Deer’ derivedfrom his time in Mexico and the newspaper article, in what Valdez considersto be his most personal play to date. Armida, Valdez’s mother, isre-envisioned as a young woman by the same name; his grandmothers, auntsand cousins fused into the other leading characters. The main action of theplay takes place in 1999 by the side of Mama Chu’s hospital bed, but alsoflashes back to 1969 when the Chicano Movement was just starting, backthrough the thirties and twenties, to the turn of the 20th Century and theMexican Revolution when Mama Chu crosses the border into the United States.The genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico, forcing Mama Chu to migrateto the US, is only one of the family’s buried secrets. In spite of thefluidity of time zones, what anchors all the action is the constantpresence of a young Yaqui deer dancer who dances but does not speak,symbolizing the 60-year-old mummified fetus. The play incorporates themesof family conflict within the broader context of history and socialstruggle.

Mendive blends significant elements of Afro-Cuban culture, creating a personal universe intimately linked to his particular worldview, one that establishes organic connections between nature and religion, African ancestry and Caribbean everyday life, a symphony of syncretism that, like all of Mendive’s art, reflects a life of commitment to African spiritual practices, a commitment that became more intense after his first visits to Africa in the early 1980s.

In this performance, brightly-colored bodies streak through the streets of Havana, shouting and gesturing wildly, dancing in sync, carrying ducks. Aaron Vega's video documents this exuberant public body art performance, including scenes of Mendive's unique method of preparing the performers: painting some with bright animals and abstract shapes, and covering others entirely in one color. Manuel Mendive Hoyo (www.mendive.cult.cu) is perhaps the single most important Cuban artist today. Mendive, a major exponent of contemporary ‘Afro-cubanismo’ in the visual arts, was born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family. He graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Plásticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting. He held his first one-man show at the Center of Art in Havana in 1964. Since then he has exhibited in some of the most important international venues. The Cuban booth at the XLII International Biennial Exhibition of Modern Art in Venice in 1988 was completely dedicated to his works. His work can be found in Museums and galleries in many countries including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, the Musee d’Art Moderne in Paris; as well as museums in Russia, Somalia, Congo, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the U.S and other countries. He is well-known not only for his painting and soft sculpture, but for his performance pieces in which he paints dancers’ naked bodies and creates theatrical backdrops and environments.

Cantata a los emigrantes' is a bilingual play with music celebrating the Puerto Rican pioneers who established communities in the United States and struggled for the preservation of their culture. At the time the play was created there were 2.6 million Puerto Ricans in the United States, with 1.6 million in New York alone. Puerto Ricans have been pushed and pulled ever since the United States took the island in 1898. Some have stayed and given birth to a second and third generation; some have returned to the island and others are still in never ending transit between here and there. With this collective creation, Pregones weaves through various social, historical, economical and personal factors that have influenced their migratory process. 'Migrants' is Pregones’ homage to the courage and endurance of those who came and worked before us. The play was created collectively by Pregones Theater, based on written and oral history, interviews and the works of writers such as Guillermo Boralt, René Marqués and Klemente Soto Beles. It was premiered at Pregones Theater at St. Ann’s in The Bronx, NY, in December 1986. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries.

Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor’s Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work.

The production grew out of Pregones’ work with Brazilian Augusto Boal, particularly as an adaptation of his Forum Theater techniques. The production toured over 100 community sites in East Harlem & The Bronx in New York, and in New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The presentations were designed to promote direct audience participation in order to heighten awareness and develop sensitivity to persons with AIDS and their families.

She constantly navigates the dual identity formed by having grown up in two very different worlds: the tropical island and ‘Los Nuevayores’ (that other place away from the island.) By way of her grandmother, she is a skilled and eloquent storyteller. Her companions are two parts of the same man, one being Spanish dominant and the other English dominant. They both give life to the eternal inhabitant of the poetic world created by the writer: a Latino leading man. They are able to embody her varying definitions of manhood.

This musical theater production provides a voyage through ancient mythologies of the Taíno people. Set to original music, the show brings to the stage the magical deities who whimsically create water, earth, wind and fire. The stories/myths include Marou and Boinayel (the Sun and the Moon), Yaya and Yayael (personifications of the beginning of time), and Deminán Caracaracol (the mischief maker) and his three identical brothers, who accidentally tip a gourd and fill the ocean basins with water and fish. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries.

The decision at hand: reach the other shore, return, or abandon all hope. ‘La otra orilla’ is based on the play ‘Obra póstuma’ by Eusebio Colange, resident playwright of the theater group La Zaranda in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. It is inspired in the tragedy of many lives lost in the Caribbean waters. Pregones infuses the playwright’s words with the company’s signature live music and physical vocabulary, and creates new characters anchored in the experience/history of Latinos in the U.S. ‘This work means a lot to us, as it addresses painful issues connected to migration. Thousands of Puerto Ricans have left Puerto Rico over the years, many other thousands have gone back. Many have been born here and with to connect with their other shore. Many don’t want to leave at all. Hundreds of Dominican, Cuban and Haitian people die as their boats sink in the Caribbean waters; many of them also make it to the other shore. Collectively, we have proven that we rise against adversity, our resistance growing each day. We hope that the play will touch our audience, and that, wherever your other shore may be, you be happy with the discovery.’ The production was premiered at the Repertory Theater of Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture in The Bronx, on June, 1996.

Thepiece is less an anthropological or historical portrait of an era than atheatrical celebration of a neigborhood’s collective memory, acarnivalesque depiction of fictional characters from the bit and pieces ofreal and fictional stories, legends and traditions of the ‘OldCountries’ that still haunt and feed the neighborhood’s collectiveimaginary. The piece is, as theater group Catalinas Sur points out, atribute to their ancestor’s hopes, sufferings and yearnings as uprootedmigrants, to the solidarity and daily toils at play in the neighborhood’spublic spaces, to the joy of their songs and their celebrations, to theirlove and their struggle for survival. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors.

Staged since 1992 andadapted to each year’s sociopolitical climate, the piece poses acarnivalesque critique of current local political events and social issues.La Catalina del Riachuelo’s songs, storytelling and humorous skitscompose a satirical commentary on politics and politicians, power and thepowerful, and events of national (and international) repercussion.Political corruption, police brutality, environmental pollution, andunemployment are some of the topics discussed in the piece, presented asthe downside of globalization and ‘Progress.' Historically, carnival–and the local tradition of the Rioplatense ‘murga’- has been a spacefor the transgression and critique of the rules of the leading classes bythe popular imaginary. ‘La Catalina del Riachuelo’ is conceived as atribute to this Argentinean popular tradition. It is a both a critique ofsociety’s political maladies and a celebration of hope, love and thehonoring of cultural heritage as social antidotes to these problems, ascohesive forces giving a sense of community to the inhabitants of LaBoca.

Three voices are present: that of a fragmented mind,that of a woman in love with absence, and the soft psychiatric voice ofreason.

This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor.

A free-wheeling adaptation and distortion of Euripides ‘The Bacchae D69’ is notable for the combination of a number of ‘firsts’ for the New York theater, including audience participation, man-to-man kissing, and full-frontal nudity of both women and men.  The Performing Garage was filled with platforms and towers, the floor covered with carpets. There were no seats which meant that performers and spectators shared the space, sitting on the floor or perched on scaffolds. ‘D69’ was created during a long period of workshops and rehearsals. The production – like all of Schechner’s work that followed – was never finished. Before each performance, Schechner gave extensive notes and made many revisions. Over the 14-month run, the roles were rotated among the cast, including a woman playing the god Dionysus (Joan MacIntosh). The Performance Group used their performances as a means of confronting the psychic, physical, social, and political work of the performer and the spectator. The film was made by De Palma and his colleagues from footage shot during two in June and July, 1968. The film uses two screen images shown simultaneously to give some feel of the totally inclusive environmental theater technique pioneered by Schechner.

In ‘The Tooth of Crime’ Shepard  draws on popular/mythic figures and motifs of the American imaginary such as the cowboy, the rock star, the girl friend, the disc-jockey, and the drifter-outsider. The language of the play is rhythmic with a richness of alliteration and syncopation that The Performance Group actors further embroidered through their verbophysical techniques to produce harmonies, tensions, and emotional and physical states. The drama embodies the contradictions inherent in a star system that creates ‘personalities’ only to discard them when they are no longer commercially productive. Using their own version of rock music, TPG explores in a complex physical environment a world of gangsters and urban cowboys. The performance presents a myriad of comic book characters that underscore the deceptions and failures of the ‘American Dream.’ The subtleties of the characterization, environmental theater mise-en-scene, music, and movement make this production unique. Because the environment makes viewing all of the action from one place impossible, spectators flow with the action from one part of the theater to another. The performance of Spalding Gray as Hoss is perhaps his best work in the ‘regular’ theater.

Food preparation and consumption is the ruling metaphor for the destructive appetites of Western expansion culminating in both the Nazi crime of genocide and the post-industrial excesses of globalization and genetic manipulation. Schechner and his colleagues rework the story. Mephistopheles played by a woman dressed as a man but not disguising her ‘actual’ gender is assisted by Hitler, also played by a woman. Part One of ‘Faust/gastronome’ draws heavily on Goethe, tracing Faust’s seduction of Gretchen (aided by Mephistopheles) and his abandoning her to her death. A considerable portion of the dialogue is Goethe’s, performed in German. Part Two Schechner describes as a ‘tragedy of development.’ Here Faust heads the ‘Fist Group’ of corporations involved in genetic engineering and global exploitation. Just before his death and damnation, Faust meets Gretchen who has come to seek him out and help bring him to hell. At one point, Hitler’s architect, Albert Speer, appears on a talk show justifying World War II and the Holocaust. Later, Faust and a neo-Nazi teenage appear on the same show.

Michele Minnick and Paula Murray Cole lead the workshop in a yoga warmup, intensive breathing and vocal exercises, slow-motion and other exercises invented or adapted by Schechner, and finally the rasaboxes. Taken as a whole, the workshop is an exploration of psycho-physical embodiments connecting the personal to the social. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach that begins with finding a particular form for the eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theatre manual, Bharata’s ‘Natyasastra.’ In the workshop documented in the film, four student participants along with the instructors commence with a warm up and then draw words and pictures in each of eight connected rectangular boxes mapped out on the floor with masking tape. The ninth, the center box, is left blank because it represents ‘shanta,’ the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud’s call for the actor to be ‘an athlete of the emotions.’ The eight, or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear, horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion), raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss). Workshop participants move within the boxes, jumping from one emotional state to the other and at times engaging interactively.

In times of political conflict, human evil unravelspower plays that had led to violence and genocide, all enacted in coldblood. Mapa Teatro stages their version of the classic Shakespearean play,in an attempt to confront and question the spirit of war and violence intheir native Colombia. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance.

In times of political conflict, human evil unravelspower plays that had led to violence and genocide, all enacted in coldblood. Mapa Teatro stages their version of the classic Shakespearean play,in an attempt to confront and question the spirit of war and violence intheir native Colombia. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor.

When women dressed intraditional indigenous Aymara clothing approach to white women to offerthem Mujeres Creando’s pink ribbons, some of those women do not know howto react – some of them think that the indigenous women are sellingsomething, or begging, and some of them ignore their indigenous peers.Collecting opinions of the mall’s female costumers, it is clear that someof them even question the fact that indigenous women can be at the door ofthe mall, ‘invading their space,’ where they should not be allowed. Onthe other side, the indigenous women who participate in the acción mentionthat they sensed that some women felt repulsion against them. With thisacción, Mujeres Creando exposed the racism that exists between women ofthe same country. This exposure of racism against indigenous people bringsto the fore a question about visibility, and what people choose to see. Bygoing to the mall in their indigenous clothes, or ‘chola clothes,’Mujeres Creando highlights the fact that racism is also embodied in aspecific way of dressing, and that ‘dressing like a chola’ is an act ofpolitical transvestism, a gesture that demands us to see that which hasbeen invisibilized.

Two women walk carrying a mirror and Barbiedolls, inviting women to question the beauty patterns imposed by apatriarchal and neo-colonial society. At the public square, a group ofwomen struggle with the mirrors, the Barbie dolls, and colored ribbons thattie and constrain them. Finally, they free themselves from the ribbons andthe mirrors. With this acción, Mujeres Creando criticize the beautypatterns imposed upon women, and the social expectations that make womenfight against women; they also question the racism embedded in Boliviansociety, where indigenous women don’t recognize themselves in the whiteskin and blond hair of the ‘model’ of feminine beauty.[BIO] Mujeres Creando is an autonomous feminist movement created in 1992 inLa Paz, Bolivia.

Inthe first part, an indigenous woman speaks while she undoes her braids andbrushes her hair. She speaks about her sexuality, and claims that she is‘una chola diferente, una chola libre’ (‘a different chola, a freechola’). In the second part, Julieta Paredes and María Galindo, two ofthe founding members of Mujeres Creando, draw a red heart at the center ofthe public square, and after offering flowers to the passers-by, they set abed in the middle of the painted heart, lay down together, hold hands, andkiss each other. With these acciones, Mujeres Creando point out how genderand body politics constrain even the more intimate relationships, and howanti-lesbianism is strongly rooted in a patriarchal society. Bringinglesbian love to a public space and talking about sexuality aloud arevehement political gestures of rebellion and resistance.

Participants included artists, scholars, graduate students, and activists. This eclectic and culturally diverse group, from countries throughout the Americas, captured the spirit of Encuentros: to provide a forum that encourages an interdisciplinary exploration of the relationship between performance and politics from diverse cultural perspectives. This is a video documentation of the welcoming by Marcos Terena, member of the Terena indigenous people, who discusses the political implications in the theorization and practice of ‘indigenous performance’ and intercultural encounters. He remembers the invasions and colonization of indigenous populations, and the ongoing history of dispossession that still affect indigenous communities. Marcos Terena’s perspective, however, is inclusive and open towards multi-cultural encounters as the ones promoted during the Hemispheric Institute Encuentros. For him, to be respected in our differences provides a ground for dialogue and learning. [BIO] The Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics is a collaborative, multilingual and interdisciplinary network of institutions, artists, scholars, and activists throughout the Americas. Working at the intersection of scholarship, artistic expression and politics, the organization explores embodied practice—performance—as a vehicle for the creation of new meaning and the transmission of cultural values, memory and identity. Anchored in its geographical focus on the Americas (thus ‘hemispheric’) and in three working languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese), the Institute's goal is to promote vibrant interactions and collaborations at the level of scholarship, art practice and pedagogy among practitioners interested in the relationship between performance and politics in the hemisphere.-----------------------------------------------------------WORKTYPE(S) (655):Welcoming remarksPERFORMANCE GENRE(S) (655):-----------------------------------------------------------SUBJECT(S) (650/653):Terena Indians -- BrazilIndigenous art and performance -- political aspectsIntercultural relations -- political aspectsIndigenous knowledge  -----------------------------------------------------------RIGHTS HOLDER INFORMATION:Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics-----------------------------------------------------------BROADCAST NOTE:-----------------------------------------------------------NOTES TO CATALOGER: This item (HI2013.021_01) is the second part of HI2013.020_03 - videos will be stitched together.

The communal life, the religiosity, the contact with the white man, disease, slavery, and the genocide of indigenous culture are shown in a sequence of eight tableaus. A procession walks by slowly, following the rhythm of a drum. The performance begins with a ritual preparation. In a circle, the indigenous people share bread and water, they sing and dance with war cries. The ceremony is interrupted by the arrival of an indigenous person in chains. The group releases him, but he falls at the feet of his companions. The tribe lets out a cry of pain, and with their bodies they form a totem. The sound of a bomb exploding is heard. The totems fall apart, the indigenous people are dead. In the middle of the circle, a single indigenous woman survives, yet three people come from the audience and surround the dead bodies with chains. The destruction is complete. The old indigenous woman sets her own body on fire. Combining masks, costumes, and choreography, the performers become live sculptures involving the audience as in a dream.[BIO] Based in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.-----------------------------------------------------------WORKTYPE(S) (655):PerformancePERFORMANCE GENRE(S) (655):Theater-----------------------------------------------------------SUBJECT(S) (650/653): Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; -----------------------------------------------------------RIGHTS HOLDER INFORMATION:Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz-----------------------------------------------------------BROADCAST NOTE:-----------------------------------------------------------NOTES TO CATALOGER:-----------------------------------------------------------"
