A typical form of greeting between leaders of the Soviet Bloc, the politicians would kiss one another three times on the cheeks, sometimes even kissing on the mouth if they were especially close. Instead of portraying Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker, the most well-known example of this kiss, Castillo depicts Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, who appear as busts worn by two nude women. As in her other works, Castillo interrogates the relationships among power, desire, and the state, here by playfully featuring icons of patriarchy atop nude female bodies.",The fraternal socialist kiss,Video performance
