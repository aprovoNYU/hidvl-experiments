Not only are fundamentalists on the rise but also many competing brands of spirituality are now widely disseminated through media, film, best selling fiction and television. While most orthodox religions have always used ritual and performance, telecommunications and televisual effects are transforming religion into religiosity. ‘The return of religion’ has become an issue. Jean Franco is currently Professor Emeritus at Columbia University. She is the winner of the PEN 1996 award for lifetime contribution to the dissemination of Latin American literature in English and has been recognized by the Chilean and Venezuelan governments for advanced scholarship on Latin American literature in the United States.

In the installation/performance space of ‘Sans Gravity’, Bustamante explores the metaphors associated with water in the physical realm by burdening her body. The weight and the movement of the water develop into extensions of the gesture and another layer of the distorted self. The audience becomes a mechanism of relief. Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Her collaborations include working with such luminaries as Coco Fusco and Osseus Labrint. In 2001 she received the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman fellowship. Currently she is living in Troy, New York and an assistant professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

An invention that resists titles like Performance Artist, Man of God, or Anarchist -- Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping have become popular as none of the above or as all three. In one form, this project is an interactive play, an evening-length church service that seems to evolve from comedy to some sort of secular spirituality that downtown New York hipsters embrace. Working in 300-seat theaters with large gospel choirs that sing anti-consumerist lyrics (‘Stop Shopping! Stop Shopping! Now we can leave the Shopping Malls!’), the Reverend usually works, like a normal church, with a theme at each service. These range from anti-sweatshop concerns, to the neighborhood defense against the economy of tourism, to animal rights. However, Reverend Billy is best known for his Disney and Starbucks store invasions, which also combine the elements of drama, religion and politics. Post performance discussion led by Jill Lane.

Audiences see Yokasta as a pre-teen, a young woman, a happily married woman, and an older woman who intelligently recollects all aspects of her life. Post-performance discussion led by Luis Peirano.  East Coast Artists is a professional theater company performing new plays and classics in new interpretations. ECA also conducts training workshops. Founded in 1991 by Richard Schechner, ECA has produced ‘Faust/gastronome,’ ‘Amerika’ (after Kafka), Chekhov's ‘Three Sisters,’ and ‘YokastaS.’  ECA emphasizes a long developmental workshop and rehearsal process, open rehearsals, and continuous revision throughout the life of a production. Richard Schechner is University Professor and Professor of Performance Studies at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. He is artistic director of East Coast Artists and editor of ‘TDR: A Journal of Performance Studies.’ His books include ‘Environmental Theater,’ ‘Between Theater and Anthropology,’ ‘The End of Humanism,’ ‘Performance Theory,’ ‘Performative Circumstances,’ ‘The Future of Ritual,’ and ‘Performance Studies—An Introduction.’ His books have been translated into Chinese, German, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Hungarian, Dutch, and Serbo-Croatian. He founded and directed The Performance Group with which he directed ‘Dionysus in 69,’ ‘Tooth of Crime,’ ‘Mother Courage and Her Children,’ ‘Oedipus,’ and many other works.

The arts and cultural creations colored by the African knowledge ostensibly reveal the ingenious and arduous means of survival of the African memory transplanted to the Americas by the diasporic Atlantic slave-trade and by other transcultural and transnational routes. Introduction by Zeca Ligiero.  Leda Martins is Professor of Literature, Arts and Sciences at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. A major theorist of Afro-Brazilian religious performance, she has done extensive work on 'congados' and other forms of diasporic worship that participate in the transmission of Afro-Brazilian memory and identity. Her books include: ‘O Moderno Teatro de Corpo Santo’, Editorial UFMG, 1991; ‘A Cena em Sombras’, Editorial Perspectiva, 1995;  ‘Afrografias da Memória’, Editorial Perspectiva, 1997 and ‘Os Dias Anônimos’, Editorial Sette Letras 1999.

A multi-media performance installation piece the artists create a participatory performance, inviting the audience to the ‘stage’, the entire gallery space. Using force and props like scissors, a pick axe and football equipment, at times physically violent, the two portray a scene relating to borders, migration and the process of globalization. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists.  It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.  As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ‘ephemeral communities’ of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier.  These are radical acts.

As an actor, playwright and teacher, Anna Deavere Smith has built a remarkably wide-ranging and respected career.  Ms. Smith--whose work explores the American character and our multifaceted national identity--has been acclaimed by the media, critics and audiences across the country. The Macarthur Foundation awarded Ms. Smith a prestigious fellowship in 1996, saying she ‘has created a new form of theater --a blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism and intimate reverie.’ Looking at controversial events from multiple points of view, Ms. Smith's work combines the journalistic technique of interviewing her subjects with the art of interpreting their words through her performance. Ms. Smith founded and directed the Institute on the Arts & Civic Dialogue, a three-year experiment that was held for three summers (1998- 2000), at Harvard University. Ms. Smith is a tenured professor in the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, with an additional affiliation at the New York University School of Law.

As an actor, playwright and teacher, Anna Deavere Smith has built a remarkably wide-ranging and respected career.  Ms. Smith--whose work explores the American character and our multifaceted national identity--has been acclaimed by the media, critics and audiences across the country. The Macarthur Foundation awarded Ms. Smith a prestigious fellowship in 1996, saying she ‘has created a new form of theater --a blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism and intimate reverie.’ Looking at controversial events from multiple points of view, Ms. Smith's work combines the journalistic technique of interviewing her subjects with the art of interpreting their words through her performance. Ms. Smith founded and directed the Institute on the Arts & Civic Dialogue, a three-year experiment that was held for three summers (1998- 2000), at Harvard University. Ms. Smith is a tenured professor in the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, with an additional affiliation at the New York University School of Law.

Astrid Hadad, singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City’s Centro Universitario de Teatro.  She looks to cabaret and performance to represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the same time, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls ‘Heavy Nopal.’ Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global contexts.

She is a lovelorn and timeworn artiste, a singer of torch songs, a faded night club entertainer. She is a convicted murderer serving the last days of her sentence at Oso Blanco penitentiary. She is also, biologically speaking, a male. The writer dispenses with pieties on this issue — Loca’s biology is not a scandal but a fact. Loca disputes the notion that an aging male body is no home for a lady. She is vulgar, sentimental, sweet, and always sharp as a tack. She remains loyal to the memory of her beloved Nene Lindo, his brand of tough love, and his inscrutable beauty. Her crime binds them forever in shame and passion.’ Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org). , founded in 1979 in New York City, is dedicated to creating innovative and challenging theater rooted in Puerto Rican traditions and popular artistic expressions. They have performed in 21 states as well as internationally. Recent awards are: 1998 Julia de Burgos Cultural Award; 1996 Bronx Council on the Arts Award; Three 1994 ACE Awards (critic Award) for Best Production and Best Supporting Actors; 1992 City of New York Mayor's Award for Arts and Culture. Jorge B. Merced is an Associate Artistic Director of Pregones Theater and has been a member of the company since 1987. As one of Pregones' principal artists, Jorge has performed in over 30 productions, directed and co-directed several major company productions, and coordinated all specialized workshops and master classes. Jorge is also creator and director of several projects such as Asunción (a Latino playwright's laboratory exploring issues of difference and transformation at the limits of queer identity), The Embrace AIDS Theater Project, and all company Theater & Education projects. Alvan Colón Lespier is an Associate Artistic Director of Pregones Theater, joining the company in 1981. He is the producer for the company's national and international Touring and Residencies Program, the Visiting Artists Series, Conversations on Culture at Pregones Studio and Pregones Summer Stage.

DanzAbierta sings and winds itself wordlessly through Gershwin, Mozart, Pergolesi, and Simons and only interrupts itself as one or the other dancer breaks out of the line, fails to meet the tone and steps into action individually. To the repeated question ‘¿Por qué te vas?’ (‘Why are you leaving?’), this choreographic work explores the tightrope balancing acts between the individual and the collective, their affects and perils, their complex ethical and political implications. Founded in 1988 by Marianela Boán, the Cuban dance company DanzAbierta has presented internationally at festivals and on tours in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. The award winning dance company is known for its unique style mixing artistic expressions of theater, the visual arts, and singing.  Marianela Boán graduated from the National School of Dance in 1971 and received a degree in Hispanic Literature and Language from Havana University in 1981. For 15 years she worked as a dancer and choreographer for the dance company, Contemporary Dance of Cuba, which toured internationally. In 1988, she founded DanzAbierta where she has created a signature style mixing visual arts, theater, singing and music with dance to work through harsh contemporary conflicts. She calls her style 'danza contaminada' (‘polluted dance’).  Her other choreography works have included the Cuban National Ballet, Venezia Balleto, and film works in Cuba, Canada, and Spain.

520 bb $a Video documentation of Jesusa Rodríguez, Liliana Felipe and Regina Orozco’s ‘New War, New War’ presented as part of the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title ‘Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere.’ In this farcical, multimedia political cabaret/musical theater production, Rodríguez, Felipe and Orozco ask whether humor can elucidate politics in times of crisis and war.  The piece was written in particular response to the U.S. ‘war on terror’ and the build-up to what we now know of the Iraq war of 2003. This performance brigs to the forefront a reflection on six aspects of the War on Terror: the destruction of a cosmic order; a fourth world war in a neo-prehistoric era; a political war in the global village; a genetic revolution; a gender war; and a cultural war. The performance combines multi-media sets with traditional opera from Orozco, music from Felipe and political satire from Rodríguez. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist, Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. She and her partner, Argentine singer/actor Liliana Felipe, own and operate El Hábito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. They have won an Obie for Best Actor in ‘Las Horas de Belén, A Book of Hours’ (1999) with Ruth Maleczech and New York-based Mabou Mines. Rodríguez contributes regularly to Mexico´s most important feminist journal, Debate Feminista. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito. They 'married' in February, 2000. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). Regina Orozco (‘La Megabizcocho’) is a Mexican interdisciplinary ‘soprano vedette’ who fulfilled her music and theater studies in the National Conservatory of Music, the Theater Center of UNAM and in the Julliard Music School in New York. Among the prices she has earned are the acting scholarship ‘Salvador Novo,’ the First Place in the Opera contest of Palm Beach, Florida, finalist in the singing contest of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and one of the awards of Operalia II. She was nominated as best actress in the Film Festival of Venice for her performance in ‘Profundo Carmesí,’ for which she also received an Ariel award in 1997.  She has worked in different productions with the company Divas A.C., directed by Jesusa Rodríguez, among which are ‘Donna Giovanni,’ ‘Atracciones Fénix,’ ‘Ambrosio o la Fábula del Mal Amor,’ and ‘La Sumanita,’ where she acted as leading roles for a period of four years of tours in Europe and North America. In addition to her extensive credits as producer, writer, actress, singer and performer in diverse film, theater, cabaret, opera and world music projects, Regina Orozco is, since 1999, the director and producer of her theater company, Regina Orozco y Los Tigres de Sumatra (Regina Orozco and the Sumatran Tigers). Both an artist ad a political activist, Orozco is constantly supporting social causes campaigns as the empowerment of indigenous women, the protection of street children, gender equality and the rights of homosexuals.

  a fourth world war in a neo-prehistoric era; a political war in the global village;
  a genetic revolution; a gender war; and a cultural war. The performance combines multi-media sets with traditional opera from Orozco, music from Felipe and political satire from Rodríguez. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist, Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. She and her partner, Argentine singer/actor Liliana Felipe, own and operate El Hábito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. They have won an Obie for Best Actor in ‘Las Horas de Belén, A Book of Hours’ (1999) with Ruth Maleczech and New York-based Mabou Mines. Rodríguez contributes regularly to Mexico´s most important feminist journal, Debate Feminista. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito. They 'married' in February, 2000. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). Regina Orozco (‘La Megabizcocho’) is a Mexican interdisciplinary ‘soprano vedette’ who fulfilled her music and theater studies in the National Conservatory of Music, the Theater Center of UNAM and in the Julliard Music School in New York. Among the prices she has earned are the acting scholarship ‘Salvador Novo,’ the First Place in the Opera contest of Palm Beach, Florida, finalist in the singing contest of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and one of the awards of Operalia II. She was nominated as best actress in the Film Festival of Venice for her performance in ‘Profundo Carmesí,’ for which she also received an Ariel award in 1997.  She has worked in different productions with the company Divas A.C., directed by Jesusa Rodríguez, among which are ‘Donna Giovanni,’ ‘Atracciones Fénix,’ ‘Ambrosio o la Fábula del Mal Amor,’ and ‘La Sumanita,’ where she acted as leading roles for a period of four years of tours in Europe and North America. In addition to her extensive credits as producer, writer, actress, singer and performer in diverse film, theater, cabaret, opera and world music projects, Regina Orozco is, since 1999, the director and producer of her theater company, Regina Orozco y Los Tigres de Sumatra (Regina Orozco and the Sumatran Tigers). Both an artist ad a political activist, Orozco is constantly supporting social causes campaigns as the empowerment of indigenous women, the protection of street children, gender equality and the rights of homosexuals.

Based on Luis Enríquez & Sergio Bardotti’s ‘Los Saltimbanquis’ and the Brothers Grimm’s classic fairy tale ‘The Town Musicians of Bremen,’ the performance tells the story of the journey of four musician animals from four different regions of Peru: an Afro-Peruvian hen ('La Plumosa'), a donkey from the Southern plains ('El Burro'), a cat from the rainforest region ('La Michicha'), and a dog from the Northern coastal area ('El Chusco'). The animals abandon their hometowns in search of their dreams in the capital city; upon meeting each other along the way, and after many adventures and exploits, they decide to form a music group, the ‘Músicos Ambulantes’ (‘Traveling Musicians’), and to tour the country telling their multiethnic story. The resulting performance, by now a classic piece in Yuyachkani’s repertoire (performed since 1983), is a popular musical theater celebration of Peruvian cultural and ethnic diversity. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theatre,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

Through the rituals of feminine transformation, using clear packing tape and haphazard make-up, Bustamante creates a distorted reality of beauty with all of its eros and defeat. This tragic/comedy takes the viewer on a bizarre circus-like adventure of ladder climbing and breath-holding tension.  Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Her collaborations include working with such luminaries as Coco Fusco and Osseus Labrint. In 2001 she received the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman fellowship. Currently she is living in Troy, New York and an assistant professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

The performance aims to illustrate the contradictory aspects of mestizaje in which the genocide and rape of one race led to the creation of a new race. Furthermore, it looks to redefine mestizaje to incorporate mixed race and queer identities, portraying subversive yet fluid identities to dismantle the binaries created by colonial constructs relating to race and gender. Theories of contact between ancient civilizations and extraterrestrials influenced the performance artist's vision of a cosmic mestizaje in which the impending transformation of the world as we know it may lead to possibilities for the creation of a new existence and way of being. Gigi Otálvaro-Hormillosa, also known as the Devil Bunny in Bondage, is a San Francisco based interdisciplinary performance artist, video artist, cultural activist, curator and percussionist of Filipino and Colombian descent. She is originally from Miami, Florida and received her B.A. from Brown University where she created an independent concentration entitled 'Hybridity and Performance.' She is currently the Artistic Director of (a)eromestiza, an interdisciplinary arts organization dedicated to presenting experimental video and performance work by queer and/or people of color. She has also worked with non-profit organizations such as Proyecto ContraSIDA Por Vida, New Langton Arts, Galería de la Raza, the Queer Cultural Center, Asian American Theater Company and the Asian Pacific Islander Cultural Center. She has worked on various artistic collaborations under the mentorship and direction of performing artists such as Pearl Ubungen, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Elia Arce and Afia Walking Tree. Her work in performance, video and writing has been presented nationally and internationally. She has received grants from the Franklin Furnace Fund for Performance Art, the San Francisco Art Commission Cultural Equity Grants Program, the Potrero Nuevo Fund Prize and the Zellerbach Family Fund.

Stoklos combines voice, gestures and a sense of humor in a play not specifically anchored in particular time or place. The range of images raised by monologue and lyrics are enormous, but no more than the visual ones created by Ms. Stoklos’ face and movements. She is Mary Stuart in the dungeon. The next movement, with no changes of costume, she is Elizabeth I. Seconds later we are in Brazil. Four hundred years have elapsed. It is the present day, but the power structure remains very much the same. Denise Stoklos is a Brazilian playwright, director and actress, who has, over the past thirty years, created a body of theatrical works called ‘Essential Theater’ which deals with the energy of body, voice, and intuition under a mind of historical reference: Mary Stuart (1987), Un-Medea (1989), Casa (1990), 500 Years—A Fax from Denise Stoklos to Christopher Columbus (1992), Civil Disobedience (1997), and I Do, I Undo, I Redo: Lousie Bourgeoise (2000) among others. Each is a solo play, performed in repertoire in different idioms. Stoklos has won a number of prestigious national and international awards, including many for best actress in Brazil and a Guggenheim in the U.S. She performs in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, English, Ukrainian, among others. She has presented her work in thirty countries and has published six books on her work.

520 bb $a Video documentation of Denise Stoklos’ solo performance ‘Maria Estuardo’ (‘Mary Stuart’) presented as part of the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title ‘Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere.’ Denise Stoklos takes her inspiration from various writings about Mary, Queen of Scots, and also some lines from Dacia Maraini's play and Romain Gary texts, shaping a version of ‘Mary Stuart’ imprisoned and sentenced to death by her cousin, Elizabeth I, Queen of England. Stoklos combines voice, gestures and a sense of humor in a play not specifically anchored in particular time or place. The range of images raised by monologue and lyrics are enormous, but no more than the visual ones created by Ms. Stoklos’ face and movements. She is Mary Stuart in the dungeon. The next movement, with no changes of costume, she is Elizabeth I. Seconds later we are in Brazil. Four hundred years have elapsed. It is the present day, but the power structure remains very much the same. Denise Stoklos is a Brazilian playwright, director and actress, who has, over the past thirty years, created a body of theatrical works called ‘Essential Theater’ which deals with the energy of body, voice, and intuition under a mind of historical reference: Mary Stuart (1987), Un-Medea (1989), Casa (1990), 500 Years—A Fax from Denise Stoklos to Christopher Columbus (1992), Civil Disobedience (1997), and I Do, I Undo, I Redo: Lousie Bourgeoise (2000) among others. Each is a solo play, performed in repertoire in different idioms. Stoklos has won a number of prestigious national and international awards, including many for best actress in Brazil and a Guggenheim in the U.S. She performs in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, English, Ukrainian, among others. She has presented her work in thirty countries and has published six books on her work.

This Cuban Blanche, who stays on the island while her sister emigrates, holds onto her revolutionary dreams, just as the original Blanche never loses her aristocratic spirit. Marianela Boán graduated from the National School of Dance in 1971 and received a degree in Hispanic Literature and Language from Havana University in 1981. For 15 years she worked as a dancer and choreographer for the dance company, Contemporary Dance of Cuba, which toured internationally. In 1988, she founded DanzAbierta where she has created a signature style mixing visual arts, theater, singing and music with dance to work through harsh contemporary conflicts. She calls her style ‘polluted dance.’  Her other choreography works have included the Cuban National Ballet, Venezia Balleto, and film works in Cuba, Canada, and Spain.

Pioneers in theatre and social justice in their country, in 1994 they formed the women’s cooperative, FOMMA, to empower displaced Indian women and children through workshops in bilingual education (Tzotzil/Tzeltal and Spanish) health programs, job skills and theatre. They have performed in small communities throughout Chiapas as well as at universities and festivals abroad. Forced to leave their native villages at an early age, they became maids in the neighboring mestizo city of San Cristóbal de las Casas. In the '80's they went to work at the fledging Indian writers' cooperative, Sna Jtz'bajom. It was there they became interested in theatre and received training from Ralph Lee of the Metawee River Theatre Company. They have subsequently worked with several other teachers including Amy Trompetter and Luis de Tavira.

An awakening call to the body led by, and oppressed by, globalization. Fabião explains, ‘The experience of being a ‘world citizen’ in the era of globalization produces on me, among many advantages and benefits, a disturbing vertigo, a certain existential dizziness.   I am permanently experiencing a tension provoked by the expansion of my body through all communication and transportation systems, and the dispersion of my self while perceiving the vast-virtual world’s web.  There is a centrifugal force expanding the body towards space and time, and a centripetal force condensing body and space in a timeless state. ‘Giro Piece’ is a performance art work that investigates these issues using maps (all kinds: sky maps, world maps, human body maps, subway maps…),four televisions, saliva, a dress, a woman-performer and the spectators’ presence and movement.’ Performance artist and theorist Eleonora Fabião focuses strongly on the relationship between the audience and performer, using ‘co-labor-a(c)tion’ to break down the standard active-passive dichotomy. The main thrust of her work is directed towards an exploration of the ‘poetic body’ and its creative, political and communicative abilities.

This is a shortened piece of the original production of Teatro Esquina Latina, with two actresses instead of the original four.  The play is a spectacle of storytelling that creates the scene, for young people and adults, of the daily life, humor, and the game of love in the land that is Africa. Teatro Esquina Latina is a cooperative theatre group from Cali, Colombia, founded in 1973 in the Universidad del Valle as a student group and directed by Orlando Cajamarca Castro.

520 bb $a Interview with Ana Correa, active member of Peru’s Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, conducted by Michelle Zubiate during the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title ‘Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere.’ Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

520 bb $a Interview with Nao Bustamante conducted by José Muñoz during the 3rd Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of 2002 in Lima, Peru under the title ‘Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere.’ Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language, taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Her collaborations include working with such luminaries as Coco Fusco and Osseus Labrint. In 2001 she received the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman fellowship. Currently she is living in Troy, New York and an assistant professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

520 bb $a At age 72, after 13 years of silence due to problems with alcohol, Mexican
legendary singer Chavela Vargas returns to the stage for the first time at
Teatro-Bar El Hábito in 1991. With visible excitement and emotion, she
sings from her famous repertoire of classic Ranchera songs, including
'Macorina,' 'La Llorona' and 'Soledad.' The video alterates footage from the concert with interviews with Chavela, conducted by El Hábito co-founder Jesusa Rodríguez, where Vargas comments on her singing style, her struggles with alcoholism and depression, and her thoughts on life and death. Also included is a clip of Liliana Felipe and Jesusa Rodríguez singing the ode to Chavela Vargas, 'Doña Chavela.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

260 bb $a Teatro Bar El Hábito, Mexico City, Mexico : $c 1996.
511 1b $a Jesusa Rodríguez, protagonist ; Liliana Felipe, musician.
520 bb $a In this solo performance by Jesusa Rodríguez, current pressing social and
economic problems affecting Mexico City are discussed in the context of
political campaigns to the regency of this city.  Economic polarization,
failing infrastructure, political corruption, violation of human rights,
mass media manipulation of public opinion, the religious prohibition of
birth control methods, and a severe drought are topics discussed by a
myriad of characters, satiric lyrics, and video inserts projected on the
back wall of the stage.  Rodríguez mocks Mexico's main political parties (PRI,
PAN) and the disparity between their campaign promises and the political
corruption that worsens the urban crisis.  Several candidates to the
regency of the city are proposed, alluding to actual politicians, but
expanding the political 'bestiary' to the fabulous 'Chupacabras' (the
'Goatsucker,' invoked to suck the technocrats' blood), 'Babe, el Puerquito
Valiente' ('Babe, the Brave Piglet,' a symbol of 'dirty politics'), Keiko
the Whale ('all regents are animals... at least this one needs water as
much as the rest of the population'), and even resorting to propose
Coatlicue, Aztec goddess of life and death (who promises to end
privatization, greed, and corruption among 'her children').  An alternative
'History of the Collapse of Tenochtitlan' and the satiric version of
Venezuelan folk song 'Alma Llanera' are examples of how this performance
confronts streetwise wits with the mirage of urban prosperity advertised by
TV commercials, newscasts, and political campaign slogans, acknowledging
how electoral decisions affect 'the future of Mexico... if there's such
thing.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

mock version of Alfred Hitchcock's bathtub murder scene, related to Mexico
City's drought), to satirical voice-overs for Mexican TV ads and newscasts,
in order to expose and discuss the economic polarization, failing
infrastructure, political corruption, violation of human rights, mass media
manipulation of public opinion, the religious prohibition of birth control
methods, and a severe drought affecting Mexico City, in relation to the
political campaigns to the regency of the city.  Several 'candidates' to
the regency are proposed, including Keiko the whale ('all regents are
animals... at least this one needs water as much as the rest of the
population').  Biased newscast information is exposed inasmuch as it
accents the disparity between the urban crisis and the mirage of urban
prosperity advertised by TV commercials, newscasts, and political campaign
slogans; the highlighted relationship between the drought and political
corruption points to an acknowledgment of how electoral decisions affect
'the future of Mexico... if there�s such thing.'

520 bb $a 'To kill, or not to kill?  That is the question.'  This farcical cabaret
performance, featuring Susana Zabaleta and Regina Orozco, poses the
'question' of violence in the context of current Mexican urban society.  In
a sort of film noir ambiance, the detective/cheerleader characters mix bel
canto, circus music, marches, flamenco, rancheras, and pop ballads (musical
score by Liliana Felipe) to connect the diverse skits on social violence.  
The tension between technology and nature (the cult of technology, here
called the 'Faith of the Great Father, King Toshiba,' versus an esoteric,
macrobiotic approach to natural forces), the relationship between the
Church and the Army as violent power instances (with 'obscenity' as a
common tool for the control and manipulation of society), the notion of
public surveillance, as well as police brutality, government bureaucracy
and political corruption are here juxtaposed to road violence, passion
crimes, fashion 'rituals' and star/fan twisted relationships, testing and
rethinking the limits of power, discipline and violence.  Improvisation and
the manipulation of diverse props (guns, masks, wigs) connect the music and
the skits to the presence of the audience, aided by the onstage support of
director Jesusa Rodríguez as prop assistant. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

520 bb $a This cabaret performance is a satiric homage to Mexico's famous songwriter
Francisco Gabilondo, whose children's radio show, broadcasted for almost 30
years (1934-1961) introduced the iconic character 'Cri-Cri, El Grillito
Cantor' ('Cri-Cri, The Little Singing Grasshopper').  Jesusa Rodríguez,
playing the part of a sadistic elementary schoolteacher, orchestrates a
'recital of fifth graders' (featuring Mexican singers Adriana Díaz de León
and Eugenia León, along with the cast from cabaret ensemble Divas), where
Gabilondo's songs are juxtaposed with satiric interpretations, confronting
naive lyrics with violent behavior, drug dealing, graffiti painting, etc. 
Their social critique is highlighted by the attitude of Rodríguez's character,
a religious teacher aligned to the government in power, whose prejudices
are evident in her attempt to conduct a 'didactic tribute' while insulting
the songwriter, the audience, and the students.  The 'homage,' comprising
nineteen well-known Cri-Cri songs like 'La marcha de las letras,' 'La
muñeca fea,' 'Di ¿por qué�,' 'El comal y la olla,' and 'El chorrito,'
features Paz Águila (famous Mexican bolero singer of the duet 'Las Hermanas
Águila'), with an ensemble of 'grasshopper' musicians directed by Liliana
Felipe. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

a show that is a cross between a 'pastorela' (Nativity play) and a

of Nazareth as two wealthy Mexicans tormented by the ambiguous sexuality of
their cross-dressing son, Jesus Christ. In a failed attempt to 'straighten
him out,' they employ a prostitute ('María Magdalena' Lengüinsky), who ends
up discovering that Jesus is really a hermaphrodite, that he is pregnant,
and that the father of his unborn child is St. Joseph himself. When Jesus
gets an abortion, Lengüinsky sees her chance to profit from the situation:
she blackmails the Holy Family by threatening to go public with the truth
about Jesus. Putting their own social status first (including Joseph's
political career as a candidate to the Mexican presidency), the Holy Family
decides to sacrifice Jesus and sells Lengüinsky the copyright to all images
of the crucifixion. 'El Derecho de Abortar' is a poignant satirical
commentary on the corruption, intolerance, and contradictory morality at
work in the catholic-capitalist society of Mexico.

Cruz (1648-1695), here supposedly jailed in Mexico's Almoloya high security
prison in year 2000. In an anachronistic space that interweaves the 17th
and the 20th centuries, Sor Juana writes a letter to the press condemning the
corruption of Carlos Salinas de Gortari's presidency. Brilliantly parodying
Sor Juana's sonnets, Rodríguez develops a hilarious plot of transvestite
lawyers, lesbian love, malfunctioning computers, and sushi rolls, to
critique the state's use of censorship and persecution to silence any
voices of dissent. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

520 bb $a In this Eugenia León's cabaret concert, performed at Teatro Bar El Hábito,
Alfred Hitchcock (played by Alejandro Calva) narrates a 'Private Eye'
story, a duel of wits between a Mexican diva-cum-exceptional detective (León)
and her archenemy, Jack 'El Declamador' (or 'Jack, the Declamator,' played
by Jesusa Rodríguez).  Singing well-know romantic songs ('Envidia,'
'Perfidia,' 'Frenesí,' 'La tirana,' 'Lo mismo que usted,' 'Piel Canela,'
and 'Quizá, quizá, quizá,' among others), León must save 137 kidnapped
children from Jack's affected declamation of Latin American Modernist
poetry, while contesting the villain's request for support to his
candidate to the upcoming Mexican presidential elections: Paco Stanley,
a popular Mexican declamator.  In order to save the day, León has to solve
the mystery proposed by the villain: to figure out the identity of the
alleged murderer of Marilyn Monroe (also played by Rodríguez)... in 10
minutes!  With the help of her boleros and the study of 'some documents,'
the detective concludes that Hitchcock is Monroe's assassin, and proceeds
to arrest him.  Thankful for solving the mystery, Marilyn shares with
Eugenia her secret technique for achieving her famous 'floating white dress
effect'...  After solving the enigma, León and Jack clash in a deadly duel of
wits, until the 'Musa Inspiradora' (or 'Inspirational Muse', also played by
Calva) gets in their way.  Improvised insults, tricky moves, and phone calls
from the Presidential House all contribute to León's victory and to Jack's
escape. The Muse takes sides with the detective and promises to inspire her
to sing 'like a goddess'...  concluding a magnificent concert, that inspired
an 'encore' request by Eugenia's eager audience. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.

520 bb $a In this cabaret performance, Jesusa Rodríguez poses a satiric comment on
the commodification of the posthumous image of Eva Duarte de Perón by
literature, film, and pop culture.  In a direct comment on the American
musical 'Evita,' Rodríguez proposes an 'alternative' history of Duarte de
Perón's final days and the ultimate disposal of her corpse, playfully
clashing historic, real, fictional, virtual and anachronistic conceptions
of time and place.  'In the face of Latin America's current social,
economic, and political crisis, in an era of globalization and profound
impasses, we can't help but ask ourselves a pressing question: who was Eva
Perón, and what happened to her corpse?': a satiric comment on Western
society's priorities, meshed with original and traditional tangos and
milongas (performed by 'el Gaucho del Wonder Bra' Liliana Felipe), these
questions articulate the piece as a set of three interconnected skits.  The
performance starts with a radio show featuring biographies of key female
public figures in Latin America (sponsored by 'Jabón Radical' ('Radical
Soap,' which 'cleans and reestablishes social order').  The second segment
is the enacted story of the 'final events' in Evita's life: Eva (performed
by Rodríguez) bought a radio station to counteract her detractors' versions
of her life and death, and 'reenacts' her final days with the aid of her mother
(who is about to give birth to President Carlos Menem, and wants to get the
access code to Evita's bank accounts), a nurse, and a foley assistant.  The
third and final skit takes us to a Mexico City's Customs office, where
corruption, drug dealing, and political coups brew, resulting in a change
of government that intends to use Evita's body (held in customs on its way
to the U.S., where Madonna intended to use it as a promotional object for
her movie) as sorts of flag for the 'incorruptibility' of the new 'national
body.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

coartada, la gente ansía que llegue el fin del mundo' ('Every invention
implies a catastrophe [...] like suicides looking for an alibi, people
anxiously await the end of the world'): Italian genius Leonardo Da Vinci
(performed by Jesusa Rodríguez), 600-year-old thanks to his discovery of
the elixir of immortality, wants to put an end to his life.  Living in
current Mexico City, the artist strains to recover his artistic talent,
while fruitlessly trying to regain hope in humanity, lost because of
society's gradual 'sinking' ('hundimiento') and widespread decadence
produced by so-called 'Progress.'  'How to paint the end of the world?' 
Leonardo looks for inspiration in Bob Ross' televised painting classes, in
the moral support of his assistant/lover Francesco (Liliana Felipe), in
'interactive painting' (creating an 'interactive' Giocconda with an
audience member as his model), in the analysis of Mexico's political
'gallery of terror,' and in watching a fellow Leonardo (Di Caprio) in the
film 'Titanic' over and over again.  Concluding that humanity is
self-destructive, that Renaissance utopias can't survive in an age of
technocracy, and that every good invention sinks like the Titanic, Da Vinci
finds the antidote to immortality and performs 'his masterpiece' -suicide-
which he dedicates to former Secretary of Tourism and regent mayor of
Mexico City (charged of corruption and embezzlement) Oscar Espinosa
Villareal. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

Leonardo Da Vinci (played by Jesusa Rodríguez), living in current Mexico
City and being 600-year-old (thanks to the elixir of immortality), reads
about the creation and evolution of humanity, in an attempt to counteract
his loss of hope in front of society's gradual 'sinking' ('hundimiento')
and widespread decadence produced by so-called 'Progress.'  This is a mock
version of the Genesis as forged by multinational companies, a satirical
rendering of social commodification, consumerism, and excessive love
for technological innovation at the expense of quality of life as evidenced
in Mexico City's urban landscape.

explores popular archetypes present in the collective imagery, rooted in
the tradition of XIX-century satiric lithography, turns the traditional
theater genre of the 'pastorela' (Nativity play) on its head. The resulting 'partorela�' (a pun for 'parto' or 'delivery,'
'birth,' 'enlightment') presents La China (impersonation of Mexico City by Jesusa
Rodríguez), about to give birth to 'El Niño' (a climate phenomenon?  The
Blessed Child?) at 'a hermeneutic and metaphysical crossroads': Mexico
City's subway system.  In a satiric reenactment and actualization of Mexican
archetypes in the context of current sociopolitical events, La China's
uterus is stolen in a convergence of police brutality, political
corruption, the involvement of a militaristic Church, all wrapped in satiric, underdog picaresque.  A
heated debate arises on the baby's fate as characters El Maromero (the
corrupted politician), El Cura (the corrupted Church) and El Pulque
(Mexican folk inspiration and wisdom) each has in his power an element of
China's 'extrauterine pregnancy': the uterus (stolen by El Maromero), the
zygote (destined by El Cura to have a 'moral' delivery), and the shadow (or
'soul,' in the custody of El Pulque).  In order to recover her pregnancy's
constituting parts, La China has to get involved with the campaigns of candidates to the Secretary of Education,
the Ministry of Culture, the Secretary of Treasury, and the Presidency in the upcoming Mexican elections.  After recovering the parts, and with
the aid of El Pulque, La China gives birth to El Niño (a big-headed baby),
who in his 'intrauterine gibberish' -simultaneously translated by La China-
asks the audience for petitions to be considered in his candidacy for the
Presidency of Mexico.  The Army, the Corrupted Politician and the
militarized Church, who had before manipulated, puppet-like, an effigy of President
Ernesto Zedillo in a satiric song on military interventions in
Chenhaló, Chiapas, end up crucifying El Niño, leaving open the question of what will
happen in the next presidential elections.

Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

520 bb $a La Chinga is a Mexican theater company devoted to the development of an
itinerant, populist, inclusive, journalistic street performance ensemble. 
It intends to explore, recuperate and document the corporeal, vocal and
musical characteristics of Mexico's popular archetypes present in the
collective imagery and rooted in the tradition of satiric lithography as
developed at the end of the XIX century by artists like José María
Villasana, Daniel Cabrera, José Guadalupe Posada and Constantino Escalante,
among others.  The result, a sorts of Mexican Commedia dell'Arte -with
improvisational twists and turns aiming to evidence vices in social
conduct- is less an archaeological 'reconstruction' than a humorous,
satiric reenactment and actualization of these archetypes in the context of
current sociopolitical events in the public sphere.  Some archetypical
characters -depicted in masks created by Sheila Goloborotko- are: 'El Hijo
del Ahuizote' (the persecuted and censored journalist), 'Doña Caralampia
Mondongo' (the spirit of criticism), 'Don Catrín de la Fachenda' (the
pretentious deceiver),  'La Jamona' (the socialite old maid, stalker of
young men), 'El Dictador' (the figure of power and authoritarism), 'El
Padre Cobos' (the anticlericalist), 'El Maromero' (the exploitative
politician who, no matter what, is always back on his feet), 'El Lépero'
(the eternal underdog, the moral contagium), 'El Pulque' (the folkloric
embodiment of inspiration), 'El Pelado' (the builder of the nation), 'La
China' (the brave townswoman), and 'El Cuico' (the roguish policeman).  The
cast is conformed by Liliana Felipe, Bibiana Goday, Flor Eduarda Gurrola,
Diego Jáuregui, Clarissa Malheiros, Andrés Loewe, Diego Luna, Tito
Vasconcelos, and Jesusa Rodríguez.  This documentary video is a sorts of
presentational, introductory manifesto of the La Chinga project. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects.

She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body.

perform humanity's war against nature, in a 'metaphysical' reflection on
terrorism, surveillance, and the society of spectacle.  After the
terrorist attacks to New York on September 11, 2001, 'a hope for war is
reborn,' along with the imminent and 'longed annihilation of nature.'  A
group of women volunteer to be locked up at Mega Corporation headquarters
('a product of the global fusion of the market of perfect autocompetition'),
in a sorts of 'reality TV' show where metaphysical debates juxtapose with
beauty contests, bureaucratic limbos, and theatrical last suppers.  'Reach
Your Metaphysics 2002' is a beauty pageant where the Four Horsewomen
-representing Hunger, Epidemy, War, and Death- are confronted with
philosophical questions: what is knowledge? Will? Conscience? The fate of
the human species?  The contestants then turn into secretaries of a
government office where, between gossip and slaking off, they intend to
finish their evaluation reports to Mega on how their Ministries (of
Abundance, Peace, Truth, and Love) have contributed to the corporation's
goal and achievement of 'joyfully destroying' nature and humanity.  The
women then turn into a satiric version of Federico García Lorca's 'House of Bernarda Alba'
dramatic characters, in a supper where the daughters insist in getting
Bernarda to tell them The Truth.  Bernarda confesses that she is Mother
Nature, the Big Mother, who created her offspring in order to mirror and
contemplate herself.  The kaleidoscopic play of gazes is thus multiplied,
in a vortex of surveillance where Big Mother echoes Big Brother, both as
Orson Well's '1984' dystopia and as Mexico's homonymous reality TV show. 
Metaphysically aggravated, the Horsewomen murder Mother Nature and, left
with a barren planet, embark in 'a crusade against alien -extraterrestrial-
terrorism.' Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.

Liliana Felipe, performer.
520 bb $a Performance video inserts for 'Big Mother: El Gran Desmadre.' Here included are: 
newscast footage of the terrorist attacks to the World Trade Center in New
York City; a spot advertising and introducing Mega Corporation ('a product
of the global fusion of the market of perfect autocompetition') in its
'crusade against terrorism;' three Mexican soap opera excerpts; an
infomercial by a well-known Mexican actor; a mock newsflash on Big Mother's
surveillance cameras (installed in order to observe the Mexican population,
looking for possible terrorists against sovereignty of the State); and a
spot of 'Bernarda Alba's daughters' in a barren land, waving the Mexican
flag.   All these footage excerpts complement the show's 'metaphysical'
reflection on terrorism, surveillance, and the society of spectacle, in a
sorts of 'reality TV' show where metaphysical debates juxtapose with beauty
contests, bureaucratic limbos, and theatrical last suppers, searching for
Truth amidst a war on Nature and Humanity. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

'precarious,' 'devalued' or 'false,' encapsulates Felipe's critique on current
hemispheric sociopolitical issues, while dedicating her songs to the
'nobodies' (the dispossessed, the disempowered) of Latin America.  Songs
like  'Como Madame Bovary,' 'Pobre gente,' 'Soñé,' 'La extranjera,' 'Si por
el vicio,' 'Tertuliano,' 'Memoria Mnemosina,' 'No te
lo puedo decir,'  'Las histéricas' and 'Tienes
que decidir,' among others, are performed and commented by Felipe; the encore features
Jesusa Rodríguez singing with Felipe a theatrical and comical version of a traditional
Mexican huapango. The singers play with diverse vocal registers along
with the syllables that form the name of the volcano Popocatepetl, putting the revered song on its head.  The
couple then sings 'Mujeres del campo,' a hymn composed for a series of
workshops conducted with indigenous Mexican peasant
women in the summer of 2002. Felipe ends the concert with the tango 'Lo
que vos te merecés' by request of her audience, which that night included writer
Elena Poniatowska, publicist Berta 'la Chaneca' Maldonado, curator
Montserrat Pecanins, actress Ofelia Medina, and deputy Beatriz Paredes,

520 bb $a Reading of Aristophanes' anti-war comedy 'Lysistrata,' directed in Mexico
City by Jesusa Rodríguez and performed by an array of renown artistic and

celebrated in the context of the Lysistrata Project ('The First-Ever
Worldwide Theatrical Act Of Dissent') through which on Monday, March 3rd, 2003 (03/03/03),
fifty-nine countries hosted 1,029 readings 'to protest the Bush
Administration's unilateral war on Iraq' (www.lysistrataproject.com). 
After the reading, a public forum was celebrated, making an open call to join
pacifist/activist efforts to come up with proposals for the
denunciation of 'Mexico's national war': the political issue of the murders
in Ciudad Juárez.  Also, a call was made to boycott American products for
two months as a way of protesting the war on Iraq, while demanding, as
citizens, a firm repudiation of the war by Mexican President Vicente
Fox. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.

They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed 
for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive

space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas,

520 bb $a Farcical cabaret performance featuring Enrique Alonso, whose legendary
character 'Cachirulo' starred Mexico's first TV show for kids 'Teatro
Fantástico.' Cachirulo presents a satiric rendition of Oscar Wilde's 'The Selfish
Giant' in the light of the signing of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) by Mexican president Carlos Salinas. In 'a land far, far
away, in a big city affected by the citizens' carelessness, but that thanks to the
government... was totally devastated,' a little girl with an 'uncanny'
resemblance to President Salinas meets a vagabond who gives her terrible
news: a dangerous giant ('a subproduct of civil indignation for electoral
fraud') approaches the city intending to rebel from the abuses of
political tyranny. The giant indeed arrives, and destroys the public garden (for which the girl
calls him 'selfish'). He is then approached by villains Fanfarrón and
Escaldufa (the latter a witch, here impersonating the United States), who intend to
render him 'politically unconscious' and make him an ally in their agenda
of destruction. Cachirulo helps the girl look for a magic elixir that can counter the villains' evil influence. With the
aid of three magic talismans, they dodge the villains' repeated attacks, but
Escaldufa ultimately outsmarts them by dressing up like 'the NAFTA fairy.'
She proposes the girl to barter the control of all the hemisphere in
exchange for an elixir that erases any political 'mishandling.' Sealed the
agreement, the girl makes a public speech promising to magically transform
Mexico into a First World country, but instead wishes for hair and pours the
elixir over her bald head, emptying the bottle in the process. With no
more elixir to transform the country, the girl resorts to the argument that 'it
is not with exotic formulas that the country will improve, we require
patience, strength, unity.' Cachirulo, indignant, interrupts the political speech,
silencing the girl and ending the story. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor.

Carlota, and former President Benito Juárez await 'History's judgment.'  In
the meantime, they entertain themselves -and the audience, a 'flock' to
whom thought is prohibited- 'killing time with historic dignity.' The historical characters play betting games of dexterity (betting the political
destiny of the fatherland), play political miniature horse races,
perform a ballroom gestural dance to Catholicism, and watch a satiric
puppet rendition of 'Red Riding Hood' where a girl resembling Mexico's First
Lady Marta Sahagún teams up with an American wolf (who is in war with Iraq)
in order to kill Grandma Vicenta (resembling President Vicente Fox) and
seize political control of the hemisphere.  In the meantime, Carlota, historically accused
of madness, asks her 'magic' mirror to predict Mexico's 2006 electoral
outcome.  From Carlota's futuristic mirror (a 'reflecting film'), once
'reloaded,' springs History, who comes to judge the political characters
and the problems of Mexico's so-called progress, ultimately deciding to
stop the course of historical events.  To Carlota's question on who will
win the 2006 presidential race, History responds that no one can achieve it
except for Mexico's athlete Ana Gabriela Guevara. But the athlete (staged as a
transformed/strip-teased Juarez) refuses to get involved in
politics, ending the story, and thus leaving History as an open ended
question mark. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.

520 bb $a This is a hand-held video documentation of an evening of cabaret
performance at El Hábito in 1991. It is not a play, but rather a
free-flowing interaction between the performers/hostesses and the audience. Liliana Felipe walks on stage wearing a Viking hat and a skin-tight blue
bodysuit, helping 'Pita Amor' (an elderly Mexican poetess, played by Jesusa
Rodríguez) to her seat. While Liliana plays well-known songs from her
repertoire, Pita Amor reads poems, jokes with the audience, orders
Liliana around, and comments on everything from love, to the government, to
feminism, all peppered with the periodical request for 'un drink' and her
repeated assertion 'How I hate physical decay!'  Among the audience members
are Marta Lamas, founder and director of Debate Feminista (a leading
feminist journal in Mexico) and Elena Poniatowska, one of Mexico's most
renowned literary figures, about whom Liliana sings a song at the end of
the show. This video is a testimony to the kind of space El Hábito is: a
hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded,
progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical
humor. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.

260 bb $a Teatro Bar El Hábito, Mexico City, Mexico : $c 1992 June.
511 1b $a Jesusa Rodríguez, performer ; Liliana Felipe, performer.
520 bb $a This two-woman, one skeleton 'prehispanic' cabaret follows the trajectory of
a soul traversing the nine levels of a pre-Hispanic underworld.  An
indigenous woman mourns her dead lover, and decides to go to 'el cielo de abajo' ('the sky
below') to look for her. The journey roughly follows the route mapped out in the Nahuas'
sacred text 'Popul Voh,' as well as in Alfredo López Austin's book 'Cuerpo
humano e ideología: Las concepciones de los antiguos nahuas' (The Human
Body and Ideology: The Ideas of the Ancient Nahuas).  The script, partly
Spanish and partly Nahuatl (the language of the so-called Aztecs) is
loosely based on a prehispanic conception of the afterlife of mortal souls
during their arduous trip to their final resting place.  Ultimately, this
cabaret performance poses a poetic exploration of love, gender, seduction,
sacrifice, and death. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

260 bb $a American Indian Community House, New York City, New York, United States : $c 1991.
511 1b $a Rudy Martin, performer.
520 bb $a Rudy Martin’s ‘My Place’ is a semi autobiographical work that describes Martin's complex relationship with his mother, which has been further complicated by his move to New York City from New Mexico to pursue his dreams of being a playwright and actor. Their main line of communication has become the telephone, which has come to represent his mother's presence within his apartment. The telephone helps Martin to adjust to his new circumstances and he uses it to maintain connections to his roots back ‘home’ and  to form new connections in his new ‘home’ in New York City. Rudy Martin (1951-1993), a Tewa/Navajo/Apache Indian from New Mexico was a talented lyricist, singer, and musician who was committed to educating the non-Indian public about Indians on and off the reservation.  Martin worked as the public relations director for the American Indian Community House (AICH) in New York City. He also served as a character consultant for PBS's children's television series ‘Shining Time Station’ and earned his master of Fine Arts degree from New York University’s Tisch School of The Arts. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.

520 bb $a Spiderwoman Theater’s ‘Reverb-Ber-Ber-Rations’ weaves together stories of the Miguel sister’s experiences growing up with the ‘gift.’  According to them, ‘we all have it, the gift, whether we recognize it or not.  Through this gift we maintain our connections with our ancestors and other layers of existence.’ The performance explores their experiences growing up, specifically those surrounding their learning about Native spiritual beliefs and practices. As adults who now fully appreciate what was so carefully preserved for them by their parents and community, the sisters hope to pass on the importance of staying connected.

Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops.

520 bb $a ‘Winnetou's Snake Oil Show from Wigwam City’ is loosely based on the fictional Apache character Winnetou and his close friend Old Shatterhand, made famous by nineteenth century German author, Karl May. Spiderwoman Theater satirizes the stereotypes perpetuated by authors like May and New Ageism in general, by performing a bona fide Snake Oil Show, spoofing the New Age plastic shaman, phony mysticism, and the ‘wannabe’ Indians who have come to expect miraculous results from American Indian spirituality. Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group.

After encountering only male trickster stories, Miguel decided to build a piece around a female lesbian coyote trickster (the Coyote often plays the role of trickster and is usually male). Adding erotica to the mix, Miguel bases her tale on taboos not normally spoken of in the Native lesbian community, hair, two-timing, being uncomfortable, and getting older.

By the 1950s over 700 Mohawk ironworkers and their families were living in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, New York which they called ‘downtown Kahnawake’ after a reservations in upstate New York. For years the Mohawks commuted between their reservations in upstate New York and Canada and Brooklyn until many grew weary and permanently moved to Brooklyn. Their community flourished with help from local merchants who began catering to their needs.  Dr. David Munroe Corey, the pastor of the Cuyler Presbyterian Church, opened his church to support community activities. He attracted worshipers by delivering services in Mohawk once a month, and in 1939, with the help of two parishioners, translated a hymnal into Mohawk. This appears to be the first time Native people had a community located in a specific neighborhood in New York City.

Chan evokes the power ascribed to animal fetishes through his dance and fashion designs. His performance was conceived in conjunction with an American Indian Community House Gallery exhibition, curated by Lloyd Oxendine, which focused on Native American fetishes and their importance in the lives of Native people.  A fetish is an animal usually carved out of stone or shell that is said to house the spirit or supernatural qualities of the animal.  Animal fetishes are used by different American Indian tribes in prayer and ceremonies, and as talisman and amulets for successful hunting and fishing, procreation, agriculture, health, protection of the young and long life.

520 bb $a ‘Native American Visions,’ a concert of contemporary, traditional and jazz music featuring Jim Pepper, Arto Tuncboyachi and the a cappella group Pura Fe, was part the 1989 ‘Celebrate Brooklyn’ festival, held at the Prospect Park Bandshell. The show was opened with traditional American Indian drumming and singing and also featured dancer, Raoul Trujillo’s contemporary dance solo, ‘The Shaman’s Journey’.  Saxophonist Jim Pepper (b. 1941 - d. 1992) a Creek and Kaw Indian was an innovative jazz musician who made his mark in the United States and in Europe.   His unique style fused Native American Church music and powwow music with the experimental jazz.  His best know work, ‘Pepper's Pow Wow,’ was released in 1971.  Pepper was a big influence on Muscogee poet Joy Harjo, and collaborated with the Native women's a cappella group, Ulali. He was inducted into the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame posthumously after his tragic death following his battle with lymphoid cancer.  Pepper is remembered for his contribution to both the Jazz scene and the Native music scene, and for expanding the perceptions and expectations of both genres. Raoul Trujillo (Apache/Ute) is an actor, dancer, and former soloist with the Nikolais Dance Theatre and the original choreographer and co-director for the American Indian Dance Theatre. He is the host for a series of dancing programs and received an Emmy Nomination for Best Performer as the Host/Narrator for the highly acclaimed New York Public Television series, ‘Dancing.’ Pura Fe, (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora) are now known as and the sole members of the a cappella group Ulali (formally Pura Fe).  Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas, incorporating political, social and personal issues that affect all of humanity. By fusing outside influences with Native words and music, Ulali challenges notions of how ‘traditional’ words and concepts are applicable in the modern world. The group can be heard on dozens of albums, documentaries and movies. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.

Her father taught her how to play the guitar when she was in the first grade; two years later she was playing piano (she taught herself) and composing her first songs. Humphrey's first national exposure came on the album ‘The Whispering Tree,’ a collaborative recording of poetry and music by various artists featuring Humphrey. In 2001, Humphrey received The Native American Music Awards’ Female Artist of the Year Award, for her first solo album, ‘The Heron Smiled’ which was also voted Best Folk recording of the year.  ‘Edge of America,’ also on Makoché, was released in the fall of 2003. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.

511 1b $a Lisa Mayo, performer.
520 bb $a ‘Voices from the Criss-Cross Bridge’ is a one woman piece, developed by Lisa Mayo. Mayo describes ‘‘Voices,’ as being a piece about the different parts of our lives that criss-cross and sometimes requires healing.’ The performance is based on her personal experiences of being a part of a family that belonged to two different Native nations and her attempts to make herself whole. With ‘Voices,’ Mayo conveys the need for Indian Country to ‘mend the cracks’ caused by familial fractures—and often the cause of conflict within families, communities and between nations. The performance eventually became ‘Daughters from the Stars,’ featuring Spiderwoman Theater. Lisa Mayo, (Kuna/Rappahannock) was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.   Mayo is co-founder of Spiderwoman Theater, which is the longest running Native women's theater troupe in the country.   She studied at the New York School of Music, is a classically trained mezzo-soprano and studied under Uta Hagen.

The performance was written and performed by Brooklyn sisters Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo, (Kuna/Rappahannock), whose mother was a Rappahannock Indian from Virginia and father was a Kuna Indian from Panama. Based loosely on the sister’s travel to the San Blas Islands (their father's homeland), ‘Daughters’ relates to their experiences and attempts to connect and integrate family from the North with the South. ‘Daughters’ emerged from the Lisa Mayo’s a one woman piece entitled, ‘Voices from the Criss-Cross Bridge.’  Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group.  Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops.

520 bb $a The world premiere of D’zul Dance Company’s, ‘The Fifth Sun,’ commissioned by the American Indian Community House (AICH). ‘The Fifth Sun’ combines traditional Native dance and music with contemporary dance movements.  Michael Taylor (Delaware), director of the Michael Taylor Dance Co. and Louis Mofsie (Hopi/ Winnebago), director of the Thunderbird American Dancers collaborated together to choreograph the first dance piece in this video. D’zul Dance Company’s is directed by Javier D'zul, a native of Mexico. D’zul fuses ritual and modern dance with aerial arts as a means to communicate indigenous pre-Hispanic cultures. By transforming bodies into earth bound and airborne forces of nature D’zul breaks physical, cultural and political boundaries. This daring and unique company bridges the gap between the ancient and the contemporary in order to illuminate the vast array of drama and beauty inherent to the universal human condition. Michael Taylor is a member of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.

520 bb $a ‘Skin, Stone, Positive,’ created by Off the Beaten Path, presents historical and contemporary Native American creation and survival tales. The piece was inspired by Native peoples attempts to get their ancestor’s remains ‘repatriated’ from Institutional collections located throughout the country and reports on the close to 25,000 human remains that were studied and stored in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The Native American Graves and Protection Act, which protects existing burial grounds and provides for the repatriation of remains and funerary objects from collections in museums and universities to their proper cultural homes was not signed into law until 1990.  Off The Beaten Path was an ensemble of American Indian actors that was formed in 1984 to promote Native American Theater.  They produced both traditional and contemporary works by Native American playwrights. The Theater troupe disbanded in the 1990’s so the artists could pursue individual projects.  The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.

520 bb $a The humped back flute player known by the Hopi word Kokopelli is an ancient deity and today, one of the Hopi Kachinas. Kokopelli is a symbol of fertility in many Native cultures and is thought to bring well-being to the people, assuring success in hunting, planting and growing crops, and human conception. His ‘hump’ is often considered a bag of gifts, a sack carrying the seeds of plants and flowers he scatters every spring. Kokopelli is the inspiration for ‘Old Man Kokopelli,’ a Gateway Performance Production performed by John Jaramillo and Sandra Hughes.  This performance was one of the many guest performances from outside the New York area to be welcome into the AICH circle.  John Jaramillo conceived, choreographed and directed this production in collaboration with Sandra Hughes, the founding Artistic Director of Gateway Performance Productions, and mask carver Michael Hickey. Both Hughes and Jaramillo have taught the performing arts to Native American Youth at Isleta Pueblo Indian Reservation (NM), Red Lake Indian Reservation (MN), the Riverside Indian School (OK) and for the American Indian Institute's Project L.O.G.I.C. for gifted and talented Native American Youth. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.

520 bb $a ‘Indian 101’ is a dark comedy about a class of Indians with literary aspirations.  Set in an adult writing class a few days before Christmas, the students decide to have class as usual despite the teacher's absence.  The result is both hilarious and tragic as the critique of work soon degrades into criticism of each other and ends in all out war. ‘Indian 101’ was written by the Fourplay Theater Company. Director Steve Elm, formally a Fourplay Company member, later adapted ‘Indian 101’ for the American Indian Youth Theater Project. The Theater Project is a part of the American Indian Community House Youth Council, which serves as a cultural and social outlet for Native American Youth concerned with current issues facing the Native community. Following the play is a performance by two members of the a capella women’s group Ulali (Pura Fe and Soni Moreno).  Steve Elm (Oneida), editor of AMERINDA's Talking Stick Native Arts Quarterly, has worked in the arts on both sides of the Atlantic. Trained at London's Rose Bruford College, Steve has appeared as an actor in film, television and on the stage. He has worked as a playwright and director with London's Common Body Theatre, University of Manchester (England), the American Indian Community House Youth Theatre Project, and was a founding member of Chuka Lokoli Native Theatre Ensemble in New York City.  Ulali, formerly known as Pura Fe (a seven member group) is an a cappella women's trio that features Pura Fe (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora).  Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas and incorporate political, social and personal issues affecting all human beings. This evening only two members Pura and Soni perform a set of their own songs.

520 bb $a For several years the American Indian Community House (AICH) produced a cable network show titled ‘Native America.’  Performances in the Circle at AICH were videotaped, edited, and aired on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network in half hour segments. This episode of ‘Native America’ contains a performance by members of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers, the first piece features two female dancers and the second, two male— in both one dancer does traditional Native dance while the other does improvisational dance. The male dancers are Louis Mofsie (Hopi/Winnebago) and Michael Taylor (Delaware). The episode also features the Native American blues-rock group ‘Indigenous,’ which consists of three brothers, Mato Nanji (vocals and guitar), Pte (bass), Horse (percussion), and their sister, Wanbdi (drums, vocals). The siblings are members of the Nakota Nation and grew up on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie.  Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.  Today, the Thunderbird’s annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences. Specializing in a variety of distinct regional tribal dances, their performances are wonderfully presented with narrative stories.

260 bb $a American Indian Community House, New York City, New York, United States : $c 2001 Mar. 17.
511 1b $a Robert Venables, lecturer.
520 bb $a Historian, Dr. Robert Venables is professor and Director of American Indian Studies at Cornell University and a well respected member of the New York Native community. Dr. Venables' lecture discusses the cultural differences between European and Indian concepts of land and land ownership.  These differences, coupled with the illegal and unjust taking of Indian land have over the years led to many Indian land claims against the United States government. In 1946 Congress created the Indian Land Claims Commission to adjudicate the overwhelming number of cases Indians had filed and were continuing to file. By the time the commission expired thirty-three years later more than a half billion dollars had been awarded.  Nevertheless many cases remain pending and many others have yet to be filed.   Dr. Venables explains this complicated history and examines both the historical and contemporary issues and the legal relationship between the tribes and U.S. government.  Although the primary focus is on the Haudenausaunee (Iroquois) his talk includes issues concerning all tribes specifically, citizenship, Indian-to-Indian relationships, and the government's relationship with the tribes today.  The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs.

AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.

520 bb $a ‘Open Wounds Tlalteuctli’ was written and performed by Elvira and Hortensia Colorado, founders of the Coatlicue Theater Company. This piece is about environmental and societal violence against women. Elvira and Hortensia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theatre Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together which educate as well as entertain, while reaffirming their survival as urban Native American women. They have conducted storytelling/ theatre workshops. They are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award.  Also featured is ‘In the Spirit,’ written and performed by the Chuka Lokoli Theater Company (‘Chuka Lokoli’ means community spirit in Choctaw). A group of Indians are planning to blow-up Mt. Rushmore and while at the site their own personal issues threaten to derail their plan. The Mt. Rushmore monument is located in the sacred site of the Black Hills South Dakota.  The presence of the president's heads in the Black Hills is a site of contention, as they are seen as defacing sacred territory. Furthermore, federal law protects Mt. Rushmore from defacement by rock-climbers and other sportsman, while sites such as Mato Tipi (devil's tower), which are sacred to the surrounding tribes, are afforded no such protection.

The Group, led by Sharon Day, the Director of the Minneapolis Indigenous People’s Task Force, had been selected and invited by the Community House to write and perform works about HIV/AIDS as a way to educate youth about various aspects of the disease during gay pride week.  The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.

520 bb $a For several years the American Indian Community House (AICH) produced a cable network show titled ‘Native America.’  Select performances in the Circle at AICH were videotaped, edited, and aired on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network in half hour segments. This episode contains performances by the SilverCloud Singers, an inter-tribal drum group whose members are a part of the Native community of New York City. The SilverClouds perform traditional Native American pow-wow songs and demonstrate three different styles of dances popular at today's pow-wows.  Also featured in this episode are the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. The SilverCloud Singers are an intertribal Native American singing & dance troupe weaving the traditional with the contemporary of Native song & dance. SilverCloud was founded in 1991 and takes its name in tribute of Josephine Mofsie Tarrant, the mother of founding members Kevin Tarrant and Michael Tarrant, and current members Donald Tarrant and Judy Tarrant Fields. The singers of SilverCloud come from many tribes, and from many parts of the U.S and Canada. The group was started with the intention of using traditional methods of Native culture as a means to educate through song and dance. The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie.  Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.  Today, the Thunderbird’s annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences. Specializing in a variety of distinct regional tribal dances, their performances are wonderfully presented with narrative stories.

AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.

520 bb $a Coatlicue Theater Company produced a three-minute video demonstrating their
storytelling/playwriting/theater workshops. Included in the footage are clips from a workshop held in Chiapas, Mexico.  The company’s workshops are divided into three parts. The first part is aimed at getting participants to open up to one another to begin to work collectively. It’s devoted to exercising the body through sounds and movement to stimulate the imagination and awaken the body, mind, and spirit. The second part is designed to teach storytelling and involves exercises that develop trust, listening, and communication skills. Here the Colorado sisters demonstrate the different ways to tell a story, how to work together to tell a story, and listening to others tell a story.  Participants are then taught how to incorporate their earlier exercises into the storytelling process and work on developing a theater piece.

520 bb $a For several years Indian Summer at the American Community House has been initiated by ‘Inti Raymi,’ as an attempt to breakdown the borders between indigenous peoples in the Americas. Inti Raymi or ‘sun festival’ is an annual Incan festival celebrating the winter solstice by marking the return of the sun, which provides food, life and health. Members of the Muyuy Cultural Center in New York City shared this celebration by performing music and dance.  The video includes a short Coatlicue Theater Company performance, a demonstration of a hoop dance and other musical acts.

520 bb $a For several years the American Indian Community House (AICH) produced a cable network show titled ‘Native America.’  Select performances in the Circle at AICH were videotaped, edited, and aired on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network in half hour segments. This episode contains performances by Ulali and the Silvercloud Singers. Ulali (www.ulali.com), formerly known as Pura Fe, is an a cappella women's trio featuring three Native women singers, Pura Fe (Tuscarora), Soni Moreno (Apache/Mayan) and Jennifer Kreisberg (Tuscarora). Ulali blends a variety of traditional and contemporary indigenous music of the Americas, incorporating political, social and personal issues that affect all of humanity. By fusing outside influences with Native words and music, Ulali challenges notions of how ‘traditional’ words and concepts are applicable in the modern world. The group can be heard on dozens of albums, documentaries and movies. The SilverCloud Singers (www.silvercloudsingers.com) are an intertribal Native American singing & dance troupe weaving the traditional with the contemporary of Native song & dance. SilverCloud was founded in 1991 and takes its name in tribute of Josephine Mofsie Tarrant, the mother of founding members Kevin Tarrant and Michael Tarrant, and current members Donald Tarrant and Judy Tarrant Fields. The singers of SilverCloud come from many tribes, and from many parts of the U.S and Canada. The group was started with the intention of using traditional methods of Native culture as a means to educate through song and dance. The American Indian Community House (AICH) is an urban Indian center that services the needs of the Native people living in New York City and welcomes Native visitors to the city.  AICH was founded in 1969 and has become a de facto ‘neighborhood’ serving as a meeting place for the diverse Native community of the New York City area.  The Community House offers a variety of services ranging from substance abuse and HIV counseling, to career assistance. It is also home to the only Indian owned and operated art gallery in New York City. The AICH’s Performing Arts Department has become an important resource for Native visual and performance artists. Through its programming, performance has become an important educational vehicle, both for the Native and non-Native NY community. The Badger's Corner, initiated in the 1980’s, is an education-via-entertainment vehicle for the AICH’s visual and performing arts department programs.  Taking its name from the Pueblo legend of the four-legged creature who led the Pueblo people out of the underworld after the great flood, the intent of its programming is to inform and challenge people to rethink their concept(s) of Native American people and customs. All performances at AICH are presented under the auspices of the Badger’s Corner.

520 bb $a ‘More than Feather and Beads’ is Murielle Borst’s semi-autobiographical one-woman show which examines contemporary issues of identity for Native American women. Borst is a champion shawl dancer and wrote this theatrical comedy about her experiences competing in pow-wows across the country.  As the title implies she finds there's more than feathers and beads to the pow-wow ‘scene.’ Murielle Borst is the daughter of Muriel Miguel, the co-founder of Spiderwoman Theater, the longest running Native women's theater troupe in the country.  She has appeared as a guest artist in several Spiderwoman's productions and has also appeared in and collaborated on several works with the American Indian Youth Theater Project, which is a part of the American Indian Community House’s (AICH) American Indian Youth Council.

520 bb $a Spiderwoman Theater’s ‘Power Pipes’ is a humorous, yet serious look at the instruments that are a part of the lives of the Kuna/Rappahannock Indians.  Pan-pipes represent life's breath and the drum represents the heartbeat.  This is one of several theater pieces in which Spiderwoman Theater critiqued the misuse of Native spirituality by both Native and non-Native people. The group believes that some traditions can and should change, and challenges tradition here by playing the drum despite the opposition of some Native people, who believe women -especially those of childbearing age- should not touch the sacred drum. Spiderwoman Theater is the longest continuous running Native female performance group.  Comprised of three Kuna/ Rappahannock sisters from Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Mayo, Gloria Miguel, and Muriel Miguel, the group has travel all over the world giving performance, lectures, and workshops.  Named after the weaver in the Hopi creation story the sisters ‘storyweave’ their message in a variety of formats including poetry, dance, theater, and song.

520 bb $a This itinerant performance/installation present two 'end-of-the-century
saints' from an 'unknown border religion', in search of sanctuary across
the United States while gathering confessions on intercultural fears and
desires.  Designed as a theater of mythos and cultural pathologies, the
'Temple' proposes a ceremonial space for the reflection on ethnic, racial,
and gender prejudices.  It is divided in three main areas: the 'Chapel of
Desires', displaying 'El Pre-Columbian Vato' or 'holy gang member'
(performed by Roberto Sifuentes); the 'Chapel of Fears', displaying 'San
Pocho Aztlaneca' (a 'hyper-exoticied curio shop shaman for spiritual
tourists' performed by Guillermo Gómez-Peña); and an enigmatic funerary
vignette composed by performance objects.  Paintings of other 'hybrid
santos' hang from the walls, two 'nuns' ('chola/nun' Norma Medina and
'dominatrix nun' Michelle Ceballos) take care of the temple, and visitors
can leave their 'confessions'; the most revealing ones are incorporated
into the installation soundtrack for future performances. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists.  It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.  As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ‘ephemeral communities’ of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier.  These are radical acts.

520 bb $a As a pre-performance strategy for advertising their upcoming 'The Temple of
Confessions' performance/installation, La Pocha Nostra conducts a series of
interventions in Detroit's public sphere. Two 'end-of-the-century saints',
in search of sanctuary across the United States while gathering confessions
on intercultural fears and desires, take on key politically relevant or
visually interesting public sites. 'El Pre-Columbian Vato' or 'holy gang
member' (performed by Roberto Sifuentes) and 'San Pocho Aztlaneca' (a
'hyper-exoticied curio shop shaman for spiritual tourists' performed by
Guillermo Gómez-Peña) are walked in leashes by 'corporate dominatrix'
Michelle Ceballos and tended by 'chola/nun' Norma Medina; in this fashion,
they visit an array of public places, from a financial/downtown district
fancy café, to the US-Canada border, always followed by an entourage of
photographers and videographers from the local media that document their
'pilgrimage'. Through these performative irruptions in everyday life, La Pocha Nostra
creates the means for provoking in the "Temple" prospective audience an aura of
expectation, a bearing witness of a mythology of intercultural fears and
desires; this, in turn, would broaden the diversity of the audience, and
create a propitious environment for their upcoming 'confessions'.

of appropriation of hybridity by corporate multiculturalism. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists.  It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.  As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ‘ephemeral communities’ of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier.  These are radical acts.

participants develop constructed 'hybrid personas' based on their own
complex identities and personal sense of race and gender.  The resulting
'cultural especimens' later composed the performance/installation 'El Museo

responses by net users (www.mexterminator.com), re-interpreting their
proposals for 'hybrid specimens' meant to embody Americans' expressed
intercultural fears and desires toward Latinos, immigrants and people of
color. The resulting dioramas involve physical interaction with the
audience, encouraging visitors to engage in the reflection of their own

pirate who commandeered a commercial TV signal from his underground 'Vato
bunker', where virtual reality meets border art in a collage of footage
ranging from home movies, excerpts of earlier Gómez-Peña performances,
Mexican 'B' movies, etc. Radical politics, autobiographical material,
'reverse anthropology' and parodic traces of traditional media broadcasts
comprise the content of this legendary video art piece; its finished

As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations.

520 bb $a Documentation of a backstage interview with performance artists Guillermo
Gómez-Peña and Roberto Sifuentes by filmmaker Ed Morales, along with
footage of pre-performance preparations and excerpts of the actual
performance at the Magic Theater in San Francisco, CA.  Described as a
'high-tech Aztec Spanglish lounge operetta', this performance works through
and with Chicano stereotypes -featuring the Cyber Vato, the Mexterminator,
the Transvestite Mariachi and other Pocha Nostra 'cultural specimens'- in order to
address and examine border-crossing issues of race, gender, language,
religion, politics, commodification and multiculturalism. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists.  It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.  As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ‘ephemeral communities’ of like-minded rebels.

520 bb $a Grupo Galpão was founded in 1982 in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil
(north-west of Rio de Janeiro), and has come to be internationally renowned

is a musical based on Molière's 'The Imaginary Invalid,' and is performed
using a mixture of styles that combine Brazilian popular culture with
commedia dell'arte, circus performance and street theater. The play
revolves around its main character, Argan, a greedy hypochondriac who is
Molière's last great creation. Argan wants to marry his only daughter off
to a weak and non-descript young man, just so he can have a doctor in his
family. Against this background, the play investigates the nature and
function of theater, while also paying hommage to one of the most important
comedic playwrights of all time.

520 bb $a 'Prehispanic Cabaret' is an act of protest against multinational agricultural
biotechnology corporations (such as Monsanto) whose introduction of
genetically-modified corn into Mexican agriculture severely threatens the
country's intangible cultural heritage by all but eliminating natural corn.
'We are corn people,' says writer, director and performer Jesusa Rodríguez,
who has been politically active in in the uphill battle against the
government-backed corporations. This cabaret, unlike most of Jesusa and
Liliana's work at El Hábito, is largely non-verbal; it is Liliana's mordant
lyrics that give voice to Jesusa's symbolic body onstage as she becomes an
indigenous woman, a character in a codex, a peasant, and finally the figure
of Death. 'Cabaret Prehispánico' was performed at the Francisco Nunes theater in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled ‘Performing ‘Heritage’: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices’ (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).. The performance is followed by a Q&A session, where Jesusa tells
the audience that the Death character, besides throwing handfuls of corn up
into the air and onto the stage, was also supposed to throw (fake)
hundred-dollar bills---except they were stolen at the airport. Jesusa also
reveals that this show (performed only once before, in New York) marks the
end of their 15-year trajectory at El Hábito. 'There is an abyss behind us
and an abyss before us, and we need to take a break to think about where we
go from here,' she says.

520 bb $a Luisa Calcumil's 1987 solo show, 'Es bueno mirarse en la propia sombra' is
a plea for the preservation of Mapuche indigenous culture in the face of
the homogenizing forces of globalization. The play opens with Calcumil's
voice in the dark, introducing herself in the Mapuche language as 'a person
of the earth.' We then see her as a grandmother singing in Mapuche and
being killed by white invaders who destroy indigenous land and build
nuclear dumps. Next is the story of Julia and her mother: in dire financial
straits, Julia's mother is forced to send Julia to work in the city as a
maid. After many years, she goes back for her, only to find out she�s left
her job and given birth to a boy. Calcumil then transforms into Julia,
dancing to pop music, wearing flashy clothes. Julia constantly tells
herself, 'You're so beautiful, Julia!' 'Why think?' 'Your skin is whiter!'
She wants to forget she was raped, forget where she came from, forget she
is Mapuche. But even as she calls herself Julie and gets a Western
education, her dead grandmother appears in her dreams singing traditional
songs, relentlessly reminding her that she can't deny her roots. This video documents Calcumil's performance at the Teatro da Cidade in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled ‘Performing ‘Heritage’: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices’ (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

voices of the Zapatista indigenous women they encountered. It is a collage
of their thoughts, stories and music: the fire of their resistance,
struggle and hope for a better future.

520 bb $a Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya (FOMMA) is run by Petrona de la Cruz Cruz and
Isabel Juárez Espinosa in Chiapas, Mexico. Their programs educate
indigenous women and children in Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Spanish as well as
offering an extensive array of vocational skills and theater workshops.
FOMMA also provides services like childcare, women's rights education and
healthcare. Partly based on Isabel's life, their play 'Soledad y Esperanza'
is the story of two young indigenous sisters who have suffered physical and
emotional abuse throughout their lives. Esperanza dreams of an education
and of life in the big city. But her older sister Soledad denies her the
chance to go to school and instead forces her to work as a maid for a
dominating mestiza in the city. Despite the challenges she faces in this
environment, Esperanza falls in love with Juan, the gardener. Once they're
married, Juan and his new family return to his community, where he owns
fertile lands that promise economic stability. Their happiness is
short-lived, however, as Juan is brutally murdered by enemies who desire
his property. Esperanza, alone and pregnant, sees no future in staying
there. She decides to leave on an uncertain journey towards the border,
dreaming of a better life. This piece was performed at the Francisco Nunes theater in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a part of the 5th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, titled ‘Performing ‘Heritage’: Contemporary Indigenous and Community-Based Practices’ (http://hemisphericinstitute.org/eng/seminar/brazil2005/index.html).

the Salt River Pima-Maricopa indian community, followed by Quetzal's
original solo violin piece. Larry Yazzie then performs his dazzling powwow
Fancy Dance from Tama, Iowa, followed by the energetic and powerful
percussion of African American David Pleasant, who draws on rhythms dating
back to slavery in the United States. Dancing Earth performs a dance piece
about the creation of the earth, and the evening ends with all performers

they talk about the origins and meanings of their performances.

was conceived as a 'sampling of apocalyptic post-colonial nightmares for an
imaginary photo shoot': on its two main platforms, Violeta Luna and James
Luna perform warped versions of various 'fetishized identities' such as
Frida Kahlo and a Native American shaman. Meanwhile, Peruvian artist
Amapola Prada, donning an indigenous feather crown, lies naked on a
dentist's chair as the audience intervenes on her body with text and
objects. Gómez-Peña circulates around the space, serving as an instigator
of audience participation in what he calls a 'performatic karaoke.' As the
performance progresses, audience members draw on their own political/aesthetic
sensibilities to create images on stage. These evoke a wide range of
issues, such as the Vatican sex scandal, homophobia, alcoholism in Indian
communities, homelessness and the Iraq war, among many others.

520 bb $a Video documentation of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani’s theater piece ‘Adiós Ayacucho’ (‘Farewell Ayacucho’), adapted by Miguel Rubio Zapata from the eponymous tale by Peruvian writer Julio Ortega and performed by Augusto Casafranca with music by Ana Correa. ‘Adiós Ayacucho’ tells the story of Alfonso Cánepa, a farmworker leader from the Southern Peruvian Andes, disappeared and killed during the 1980’s, who returns from the netherworld and begins a journey to Lima, the capital city, looking for his bones so that he could rest in peace. Cánepa befriends a ‘Qolla’ (a comic Andean dancer), who lends him his body and his voice so that he could tell his story. The play is performed around a platform that supports pieces of clothing, according to the Andean custom that lays them in wake, eight days after the death of a relative, as a final farewell ritual. During the years of political terror of Peru’s Dirty War this ritual has been transformed as the only way to bid farewell to the souls of the departed when their bodies have been disappeared by the military. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

520 bb $a Video documentation of ‘Hasta Cuándo Corazón,’ theater piece by Peruvian Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. In this play, a series of characters of diverse backgrounds live together in a project in the middle of the city, from which they are soon to be evicted. Even though they are neighbors facing a common fate, the characters await isolated from one another instead of forging a network of solidarity in the face of the eviction. Each life story is told and retold individually, recreated by physical actions in a reiterative play that evidences the profound and painful dissociation between word and action in these characters’ lives. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

In this play, two dead nightclub performers return to their favorite club in Lima, which has become a city of unrelieved destruction. The performers, characters Abelardo and Amanda, try to recapture their act, their identities, their audience and a grip on life. Rising from the mists of death, or perhaps from hell, the performers --he amid racks of drums and cymbals and she in a wheelchair -- try to recover speech, coordination, a sense of each other, passion, even sex, but they never quite connect.

Due to the war, these three caretakers—the only survivors of the town—have been unable to honor their patron saint for many years. For the Hispanic Mayordomo and his mestiza employee, Bernardina, the procession would restore order and bring meaning back to their lives. Yet, for the subaltern indigenous character, Rufino, to honor Santiago would betray his cultural identity. Rufino thus decides to adopt the language, masks, and clothes of an Andean trickster deity in order to betray the attempt to restage the procession. As the program notes explain, during la Reconquista the figure of Santiago was transformed from a peaceful follower of Christ into the Moor-slaying Patron of Spain; in the Conquest, he became a killer of Indians. Ironically, Catholicism's colonizing force turned Santiago into the holy patron of many Peruvian towns, venerated by the largely native and mestizo population. This production suggests that, although forgotten by most Peruvians, a syncretic connection between Santiago and the Andean god Yllapa motivated this odd veneration. The piece merges dream with reality, past with present, as the memories of the earlier peninsular Reconquest allegorize both the Spanish Conquest of America and the recent guerilla war that ravaged the country for decades. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theatre,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

520 bb $a Collective theater creation by Peruvian Grupo Cultural Yuyahckani, based on texts by Latin American and Peruvian writers who have written poetically about love and human relationships –such as Rafael Cárdenas (Venezuela), Eduardo Galeano (Uruguay), and Manuel Scorza (Peru). The play is weaved around two words: Love and Utopia --be it the Utopia of Love or the Love for Utopia. A long-time couple kills time by putting themselves in extreme situations in order to overcome boredom and safeguard their love. They leave home and wander from run-down hotel to run-down hotel, confronting every day as if it was their very first. This piece is an exploration on the world of romantic couples, an investigation on love, encounters and disencounters, communication and miscommunication, presence and absence. Far from portraying a linear storyline, it shows a broad spectrum of sensations and relationships for and with the spectators, so that it is them who ultimately piece together the elements at play through the lens of their own experiences and references regarding love, human relations, solitude, solidarity, disenchantment and hope. Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

Truth and Reconciliation Commission, created to investigate the violence
which took place because of terrorism and political instability between
1980 and 2000 in Peru.  On April 8, 2002 the TRC went to Huamanga for a
first public hearing, followed by Huanta, Ayacucho three days after. 
Yuyachkani performed 'Adiós Ayacucho' (with Augusto Casafranca) and 'Rosa
Cuchillo' (with Ana Correa); they also participated in public actions and
vigils celebrated in public spaces to honor the 'disappeared'.  The video
shows townspeople speaking with members of Yuyachkani about their
experiences with violence, interviews with Yuyachkani members about their
experience performing and listening to the public, and footage of the
performances and public testimonies.  This is an excellent resource to
understand Yuyachkani’s relationship to their Peruvian audience -how
their work has been influenced and driven by it.

This documentary features interviews with Miguel Rubio (director of the group), other group members, and several renowned archaeologists, critics and theater experts of Peru, including anthropologist Rodrigo Montoya, historian María Rostworowski, director of the Escuela Internacional de Teatro de América Latina y el Caribe (EITALC), Osvaldo Dragún, and Hugo Salazar, a prominent Peruvian theater critic.  The documentary also includes footage of performances 'Músicos Ambulantes', 'Encuentro de Zorros',
'Baladas del Bien-Estar', 'Son de los Diablos', 'Contraelviento',
'Adiós Ayacucho', 'Yuyachkani En Concierto', 'No Me Toquen Ese
Valse', 'Hasta Cuándo Corazón', 'Retorno' and 'Pasacalle', all works that the group performed within its first twenty-five years of theater work. The documentary discusses the progression of the group, from
an ensemble of young students eager to explore theater, to an integral element of Peruvian society responding to the cultural and political issues of Peru. This documentary shows Yuyachkani’s relationship to the community and nicely illustrates the history of the plays and the theater group itself.

520 bb $a The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of
artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in
Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’,
CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an
essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the
practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a
necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between
the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and
spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday
life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the
daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that
decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations
and signs. On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milk
factory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previously
planned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where the
trucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connects
a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This
connection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum by
covering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought to
expose political violence, cultural censorship, and human misery in a
country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’s
dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so the
milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology and
Pinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist political
repression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,
dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk plant packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of parked trucks in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. The artists at its front door spread a large white cloth in order to cover the entrance. They haul down the Chilean flag.

artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando
Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used
performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the
most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated
strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all
its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of
all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that
eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator.
Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of
spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to
interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the
citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and
semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs.  ‘Para no
morir de hambre en el arte’ is a multi-faceted ‘art action’ performed
in 1979 addressing the problem of hunger and poverty, endowing milk with
the symbolic power to represent this unrepresentable political issue. The
performance consisted of several actions: passing out milk to people in Santiago’s slums;
parading milk trucks through the city’s streets; calling attention to the
performance with full-page ads in periodicals; enacting the group’s
message in front of the local United Nations building; altering the façade
of a museum to draw it into the theme of the performance;
broadcasting, through loudspeakers located outside the CEPAL building, a
critical speech; and filling an acrylic box with 100 milk bags, an issue
of the periodical ‘HOY’ and an audiotape with the broadcasted critical speech in
an art gallery.  Here shown is footage of a sheet of paper with an
explanation of the places that the action connects, along with production notes.

morir de hambre en el arte’ is a multi-faceted ‘art action’ performed
in 1979 addressing the problem of hunger and poverty, endowing milk with
the symbolic power to represent this unrepresentable political issue. The
performance consisted of several actions: passing out milk to people in Santiago’s slums;
parading milk trucks through the city’s streets; calling attention to the
performance with full-page ads in periodicals; enacting the group’s
message in front of the local United Nations building; altering the façade
of a museum to draw it into the theme of the performance;
broadcasting, through loudspeakers located outside the CEPAL building, a
critical speech; and filling an acrylic box with 100 milk bags, an issue
of the periodical ‘HOY’ and an audiotape with the broadcasted critical speech in
an art gallery. Here shown is a scrolling text introducing the performance
(in English).

520 bb $a The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of
artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in
Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’,
CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an
essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the
practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a
necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between
the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and
spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday
life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the
daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that
decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations
and signs. On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milk
factory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previously
planned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where the
trucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connects
a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This
civil action sought to expose political violence, cultural censorship and
human misery in a country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto
Pinochet’s dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the
dictatorship so the milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military
technology and Pinochet’s regime. This piece indicated that art was not
inside the museum but outside, dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is a scrolling text introducing the performance (in English).

12th, 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago,
dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society.
This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (La
Moneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic government
and the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Through
this ‘acción sobre arte y política’, CADA reconstructed the political
trauma of 1973, while proposing a new critical political perspective. The
flyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s right
to a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public was
capable of instating an entirely new concept of art — one that could
overcome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life. Here

fulgor de la huelga’, CADA enacted a hunger strike in a small
metalworking factory, which had collapsed owing to the deep economic crisis
in Chile leaving all the workers unemployed. CADA's action was meant to
denounce the growing unemployment among the working classes and to
highlight the importance of hunger strikes as political tools and ways of
resisting the economic policy of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship.  Here shown is
the 'backstage' of the action: the artists are preparing for the performance
and discussing it. Then the video presents the performance per se: first,
the artists lie on the floor, covered in blankets that read ‘CADA’, sleeping. Then they wake up and leave the scene one by one. The
video ends with footage of the factory. The image shows no movement, making
reference to the closing down of the factory.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Diamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist and
cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other
awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de
Acciones de Arte (CADA), a Chilean activist group of artists who used
performance to challenge Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. She has been an
important cultural presence during the years of the post-dictatorship
through her participation in journals such as the Revista de Crítica
Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work constitutes an
important contribution to feminist theory and cultural debates. In 2000,
she published 'Emergencias: Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,' a
book of essays which brings together some of her literary and cultural
criticism. Her narrative work includes 'Lumpérica' (1983), 'Por la patria'
(1986), 'El padre mío' (1989), 'El infarto del alma' (with photographer
Paz Errázuriz [1994]), 'Mano de obra' (2002), 'Jamás el fuego nunca'
(2007), and most recently 'Impuesto a la carne' (2010).

Both individually and as a member of CADA, Diamela Eltit was one of the
most important contributors to the 'Escena de Avanzada.' The goal was to
perform 'interventions in everyday life' intended to interrupt and alter
the normalized routines of citizens' daily urban lives by means of a
semiotic subversion that decontextualized and semantically restructured
urban behaviors, locations and signs. In 'Zona de dolor' (Zone of Pain),
Eltit places the body – her body – at the center of this political and
social re-signification: she cuts and burns herself and then goes to a
brothel, where she reads part of her novel 'Lumpérica.' Her mortified body
mirrors the wounded national body, and establishes a connection between the
individual and the collective, and the private and the public, exposing her
physicality, her words, and her voice in communion with a space that exists
at the edge of social structures. In the latter part of this video Diamela
Eltit's voice accompanies her action of washing pavement in front of the
brothel, collapsing the boundaries between her novel's words, her body, and
the space inhabited by 'public women.' Eltit not only disrupts the space of
gendered sexual transaction, but also proposes a powerful reflection upon
where the 'zone of pain' might be located in a historical moment marked by
sorrow and injustices.

alternatives to these issues.

Here shown is video material of one of the three monitors thought to
comprise a video installation piece that would reflect on the performance (this installation is still a work in progress). 
As a set, the images in the monitors pose a call for discussion on the still open
conflict between territorial isolation, censorship, and creative
alternatives to these issues.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of the writing of the poem ‘La
Vida Nueva’ in New York City’s sky. For this ‘performance-acción’
or ‘poesía-acción’ (‘poetry-action’), five planes drew white
smoke letters silhouetted over the blue sky. The poem was written in
Spanish as form of recognition for all the minority groups all over the
world. The photographs of this ‘poesía-acción’ are included in the
book ‘Anteparaíso’ (‘Anteparadise,’ a bilingual edition,
University of California Press, 1986).

[BIO] Raúl Zurita (Santiago de Chile, 1950) is a poet who, along with
other artists, created the group CADA, Colectivo de Acciones de Arte, in
1979. CADA developed a large format or ‘monumental’ public art,
characterized for being political and as a form of resistance against
Pinochet’s dictatorship. Some of Zurita’s books are ‘Purgatorio’
(1979), ‘Anteparaíso’ (1982), ‘Canto a su amor desaparecido’
(1985), ‘La Vida Nueva’ (1994), ‘INRI’ (2003) y ‘Zurita’
(2011). He has traced poems in the sky (New York, 1982), and permanently in
the Atacama desert (Chile, 1993). He has received the Guggenhaim and DAAD
scholarships from Germany, and has obtained awards such as the Pablo Neruda
and the National Literature Award in Chile, and the José Lezama Lima Award
(Cuba, 2006), among others.

520 bb $a Raw footage of CADA’s performance on arts and politics ‘A la hora
señalada’. In a neon light factory, CADA members Juan Castillo and Raúl
Zurita perform a remake of the famous duel in the American western film
‘High Noon’ (translated in Latin America as ‘A la hora señalada’).
Symbolizing a physical trace of this tense and dangerous situation, the
artists extended between them a neon strip illuminating the scene –a duel
of light, without weapons. The reference to the film works here as a
denunciation of Chilean political violence during Augusto Pinochet’s
dictatorship, and as an open call to utilize mourning as a productive force
in the struggle for civil rights. The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA)
is a Chilean activist group of artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan
Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist
Diamela Eltit) who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship
in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena
Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance
as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the
practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a
necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between
the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and
spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday
life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the
daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that
decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations
and signs.

year of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile, CADA proposed the slogan 'NO +'
(NO more). This was meant as an open text to be completed by the citizens,
according to their specific social demands (No more __). CADA invited
Chilean artists from different fields to spread this message on walls all
over Santiago. Wall tagging was the first form of NO+, but the slogan was
soon used by different collectives all over the country as a massive public
symbol of political resistance and non-conformity. This documentary shows
the application of the slogan NO + by the women's movement in Chile; the
video portraits the women's movement as an active participant in joint
efforts of civic resistance against the dictatorship.

establishment, posing an interpenetration of art, politics and social
critique in their work, and branding CADA as fundamental to the development
of a field of political resistance and critical thinking among intellectuals.

daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that
decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations
and signs.  ‘Para no morir de hambre en el arte’ is a multi-faceted
‘art action’ performed in 1979 addressing the problem of hunger and
poverty, endowing milk with the symbolic power to represent this
unrepresentable political issue. The
performance consisted of several actions: passing out milk to people in Santiago’s slums;
parading milk trucks through the city’s streets; calling attention to the
performance with full-page ads in periodicals; enacting the group’s
message in front of the local United Nations building; altering the façade
of a museum to draw it into the theme of the performance;
broadcasting, through loudspeakers located outside the CEPAL building, a
critical speech; and filling an acrylic box with 100 milk bags, an issue
of the periodical ‘HOY’ and an audiotape with the broadcasted critical speech in
an art gallery. Here shown is camera material of the action
inside the gallery. Artists and audience gather around the acrylic box; a close-up allows reading an inscription: 'Para permanecer hasta que nuestro pueblo acceda a sus consumos básicos de alimentos' (To remain until our people have access to their basic food needs). The artists then seal the box. They talk about the connections between art, society and politics, as well as about their interaction with the inhabitants of marginalized communities.

fulgor de la huelga’, CADA enacted a hunger strike in a small
metalworking factory, which had collapsed owing to the deep economic crisis
in Chile leaving all the workers unemployed. CADA's action was meant to
denounce the growing unemployment among the working classes and to
highlight the importance of hunger strikes as political tools and ways of
resisting the economic policy of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship.  Here shown is

Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of
spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to
interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the
citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and
semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs. On July,
12th, 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago,
dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society.
This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (La
Moneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic government
and the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Through
this ‘acción sobre arte y política’, CADA reconstructed the political
trauma of 1973, while proposing a new critical political perspective. The
flyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s right
to a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public was
capable of instating an entirely new concept of art — one that could
overcome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life. 
Here shown is raw footage of the airplane flight.

520 bb $a The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of
artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in
Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’,
CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an
essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the
practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a
necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between
the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and
spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday
life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the
daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that
decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations
and signs. On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milk
factory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previously
planned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where the
trucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connects
a milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. This
connection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum by
covering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought to
expose political violence, cultural censorship and human misery in a
country threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’s
dictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so the
milk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology and
Pinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist political
repression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,
dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk factory packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of trucks parked in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. There is footage shot from different perspectives, including takes from the square across the street from the Museum.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of the writing of the poem ‘La
Vida Nueva’ in New York City’s sky. For this ‘performance-acción’
or ‘poesía-acción’ (‘poetry-action’), five planes drew white
smoke letters silhouetted over the blue sky. The poem was written in
Spanish as form of recognition for all the minority groups all over the
world. The photographs of this ‘poesía-acción’ are included in the
book ‘Anteparaíso’ (‘Anteparadise,’ a bilingual edition,
University of California Press, 1986).
[BIO] Raúl Zurita (Santiago de Chile, 1950) is a poet who, along with
other artists, created the group CADA, Colectivo de Acciones de Arte, in
1979. CADA developed a large format or ‘monumental’ public art,
characterized for being political and as a form of resistance against
Pinochet’s dictatorship. Some of Zurita’s books are ‘Purgatorio’
(1979), ‘Anteparaíso’ (1982), ‘Canto a su amor desaparecido’
(1985), ‘La Vida Nueva’ (1994), ‘INRI’ (2003) y ‘Zurita’
(2011). He has traced poems in the sky (New York, 1982), and permanently in
the Atacama desert (Chile, 1993). He has received the Guggenhaim and DAAD
scholarships from Germany, and has obtained awards such as the Pablo Neruda
and the National Literature Award in Chile, and the José Lezama Lima Award
(Cuba, 2006), among others.

520 bb $a The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of
artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in
Chile. One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’,
CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as an
essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning the
practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as a
necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance between
the artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open and
spontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday
life’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the
daily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that
decontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations
and signs.  ‘Para no morir de hambre en el arte’ is a multi-faceted
‘art action’ performed in 1979 addressing the problem of unsatisfied
civil and human needs of the Chilean people (hunger, poverty), endowing
milk with the symbolic power to represent this unrepresentable political
issue. The
performance consisted of several actions: passing out milk to people in Santiago’s slums;
parading milk trucks through the city’s streets; calling attention to the
performance with full-page ads in periodicals; enacting the group’s
message in front of the local United Nations building; altering the façade
of a museum to draw it into the theme of the performance;
broadcasting, through loudspeakers located outside the CEPAL building, a
critical speech; and filling an acrylic box with 100 milk bags, an issue
of the periodical ‘HOY’ and an audiotape with the broadcasted critical speech in
an art gallery. Here shown is a text (in Spanish) describing the work, along with camera material alternating between two actions: the artists delivering milk to the inhabitants of a 'población' (a marginalized neighborhood), and the artists sealing milk and other materials in an acrylic box inside an art gallery. The artists explain the goal of the action: CADA wanted to point out to unsatisfied civil and human needs of the Chilean people.

520 bb $a The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of
artists (artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando
Balcells, poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used
performance to challenge the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. One of the
most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated
strategies of theatricality and performance as an essential element to all
its ‘art actions’, while questioning the practices and institutions of
all politics and conceiving art as a necessary social practice that
eradicated the traditional distance between the artist and the spectator.
Committed to the foundation of an open and spontaneous practice of
spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everyday life’ intended to
interrupt and alter the normalized routines of the daily urban life of the
citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion that decontextualized and
semantically restructured urban behaviors, locations and signs. On July,
12th, 1981, six small airplanes, flying in perfect formation over Santiago,
dropped 400,000 flyers discussing the relationship between art and society.
This action referenced the bombardment of the House of Government (La
Moneda), which marked the fall of Salvador Allende's democratic government
and the beginning of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in Chile. Through
this ‘acción sobre arte y política’, CADA reconstructed the political
trauma of 1973, while proposing a new critical political perspective. The
flyers contained a message that simultaneously upheld each person’s right
to a decent standard of living and proposed that the general public was
capable of instating an entirely new concept of art —one that could
overcome traditional, elite boundaries and become part of public life. Here
shown is a text describing the work in Spanish, along with camera material
documenting the performance.

of their everyday interventions on art and politics in Chile, CADA
established several self-financed journals to explore the theoretical
questions behind ‘avanzada’ art. In 1982, CADA published the journal
RUPTURA, printing 200 copies. Here shown is a discussion around the journal
in a meeting of artists. The discussion centers on the inclusion in the
journal of an interview to visual artist Ernesto Muñoz. The inclusion of
this interview generated a heated polemic because this artist was rejected
by the liberal/leftist political milieu in which CADA participated; the
interview was considered by many a wrong move. CADA members Raúl Zurita
and Diamela Eltit defend and explain CADA’s decision to publish the
interview.

Spanish), footage of the first NO+ actions in the Mapocho river in
Santiago, and a series of slides (showing diverse actions, protests, plays,

for political intervention in the public sphere.

in Chile leaving all the workers unemployed. CADA's action was meant to

520 bb $a 'Making of' documentary of CADA’s performance on arts and politics
‘A la hora señalada’. In a neon light factory, CADA members Juan
Castillo and Raúl Zurita perform a remake of the famous duel in the
American western film ‘High Noon’ (translated in Latin America as ‘A
la hora señalada’). Symbolizing a physical trace of this tense and
dangerous situation, the artists extended between them a neon strip
illuminating the scene –a duel of light, without weapons. The reference
to the film works here as a denunciation of Chilean political violence
during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, and as an open call to utilize
mourning as a productive force in the struggle for civil rights. The
Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean activist group of artists
(artists Lotty Rosenfeld and Juan Castillo, sociologist Fernando Balcells,
poet Raúl Zurita and novelist Diamela Eltit) who used performance to

520 bb $a In September 1985, CADA produced a portrait of a woman whose husband had
been killed in a political demonstration against the dictatorship in Chile;
they accompanied the image with the following text: ‘Mirar su gesto
extremo y popular. Prestar atención a su viudez y sobreviviencia. Entender
a un pueblo.’ (‘To look at her gesture, extreme and popular. To pay
attention to her widowhood and survival. To understand a people’). They
published this work in several journals (‘Análisis’, ‘Cauce’,
‘Hoy’) and in the newspaper ‘Fortín Mapocho’, all critical of
Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. This art intervention was meant to celebrate
civil protests against the dictatorship; these protests were brutally
repressed by the government. ‘Viuda’ was meant to refer to this
political situation, while pointing to women as surviving social subjects
who remained in charge of entire families and homes after the disappearance
of their husbands. The Colectivo de Acciones de Arte (CADA) is a Chilean
activist group of artists who used performance to challenge the Pinochet
dictatorship in Chile. One of the most important contributors to the
‘Escena Avanzada’, CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and
performance as an essential element to all its ‘art actions’, while
questioning the practices and institutions of all politics and conceiving
art as a necessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance

520 bb $a Fulana's 'Lupe & JuanDi from the Block' is a mock music video that explores two main themes: the hyper-commercialization of religious icons, and the 'whitening' of Latinos when they cross over into mainstream pop culture. Fulana used The Virgin of Guadalupe to comment on the commodification of religion, as her image is everywhere: on t-shirts, postcards, key chains, handbags, designer jeans, etc.; she has become a hipster-friendly Latina Virgin superstar. Juan Diego, the indigenous man to whom this Virgin first appeared, has recently made it to sainthood, but he has been 'whitened' in the Vatican's official image, which erases his indigenous traits and makes him look like a Spaniard. This is reminiscent of the whitening of Latina/o pop stars when they 'make it' in the music industry ( e.g. Shakira). Rewriting J-Lo's pop hit, 'Jenny from the Block,' this video stages the 'creation' of Saint Juan Diego by mafia-sounding Vatican intelligence (the Pope and music producer Emilio Estefan). Knowing the Catholic Church is in crisis, losing many of their flock to Evangelicals, they decide to canonize Juan Diego to attract the Latino market. Mr. Estefan gives Juan Diego a 'cross-over make-over' and the Pope canonizes him on the spot. JuanDi is thrilled by his transformation, but the Virgin admonishes him for having sold out. As the song progresses, their fighting becomes more intense, their egos take over, and they eventually alienate their supporters, who go off with an Evangelical couple who knocks at their door.

520 bb $a This satirical pharmaceutical commercial by Fulana was made in the context of the Iraq war and the Bush administration, at a time when being a 'good American,' they felt, meant falling into a kind of political and historical amnesia. The 'Amnezac' commercial, much in the style of drugs like Paxil and Zoloft, asks consumers to think about their emotional state and suggest they may need clinical treatment. 'Do you feel anxiety about world events you cannot change?,' it asks. 'Are your political concerns interfering with your patriotic activities, like shopping and paying taxes? Does the Iraq war remind you of US invasions of Latin American countries, including your own? You may be suffering from Historical Memoritis.' It urges viewers to block their long-term historical memory with Amnezac: The Most Powerful Anti-Historiamine on the Market. Fulana

520 bb $a This piece is based on the traditional Afro-Peruvian street masquerade
dance 'Son de los Diablos,' originated in the Corpus Christi
celebrations in Lima during the Colonial Period.  As the ruling elite in
colonial Peru framed it, blacks represented evil forces in a religious
drama. However, by the time of slavery's abolition in 1854, Afro-Peruvians
had appropriated this dance as a symbol of cultural resistance and
practiced it especially during carnival in the barrios where these were
relocated.  The Son was banned from the streets 1940s when President Manuel
Prado prohibited carnival celebrations in Lima.  In the 1980's the
Movimiento Negro Francisco Congo, a collective dedicated to the recovery
and revalorization of Afro-Peruvian traditions, approached Grupo Cultural
Yuyachkani to recuperate the tradition of this street dance and to perform
it on the streets once again.  The group of Francisco Congo would teach the
dance, and Yuyachkani would contribute their maskwork.  Yuyachkani
considered this dance a master dance for young actors because it includes
codification of the body, maskwork, dancing, and an active and playful
relationship with the audience. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

520 bb $a Interview with Ana Correa and Teresa Ralli, members of Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, conducted by sociologist and Dean of the Universidad Católica's School of Communication Arts and Sciences, Luis Peirano, for Peru's TV Channel 7 show 'Memoria del Teatro.' In this interview, conducted in the context of the celebration of the International Women's Day, Peirano, Correa and Ralli discuss the role of women in Peruvian theater. Topics covered include women’s role in society, the difficulty of making a living as professional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists’
work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection about these roles, a creative realm where to play with and challenge them.  For Ralli and Correa, theater has been a space for personal growth, aesthetic exploration, and social intervention.  The artists discuss the interplay between their workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issues of sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances, and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internal workings of Yuyachkani and with their audience.  This program includes clips from ‘La Primera Cena’ (one of Yuyachkani’s plays) and the Encuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought together various Peruvian female
performers of Peru). Teresa Ralli also discusses her role in Yuyachkani’s play ‘Músicos Ambulantes,’ and the role women artists play in the creation and performance of her piece ‘Antígona.’ Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

511 1b $a Teresa Ralli, lecturer/performer.
520 bb $a In this pedagogical demonstration, Teresa Ralli, one of the original and
remaining members of Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani,
explains her acting technique to a group of British students.  Ms. Ralli discusses
the artistic training of her body and her voice as well as her approach to character development.  Teresa demonstrates that body
training stresses body memory, composition and accumulation.  In terms of
voicework, Ralli discusses the need to find an 'organic' voice and the
importance of vocal interpretation; she also demonstrates the importance of
breath in voicework.  Ms. Ralli believes actors must give the voice a task, a
use of the text, and should take the voice out of its 'normal space.' To demonstrate the leap from ordinary to extra-ordinary uses of voice and text, the artist imitates popular Peruvian chants such as slogans commonly used by street
vendors; in this demonstration, Ralli switches languages, from English to Spanish to Quechua (an
indigenous language of Peru which is rarely spoken by people from outside indigenous communities, but has been consistently incorporated in Yuyachkani’s work, turning into one of
the ensemble's distinguishing elements). This pedagogical demonstration also includes object manipulation work, including exercises that explore
the weight, balance and center of diverse objects.  In order to illustrate her
research on the subject, Ralli includes a demonstration of her work with
chairs, which is a fundamental part of the Yuyachkani technique in
object-work.  Finally, the artist shows the audience some aspects of
character development, demonstrating diverse stages in the creation of one
of her characters, ‘El Chusco,' featured in ‘Músicos
Ambulantes,’ a musical spectacle created by Yuyachkani in 1983 and
still performed today.  Weight, balance, volume, flows of energy and
centers of balance, showcased in this demonstration, are central aspects in
Yuyachkani’s (re)search of what they term an ‘actor múltiple’ or
‘multiple actor,’ a performer who explores and embodies the interplay between technique and sensitive/bodily memory. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

520 bb $a Street action created by Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani in May 2002 and
performed during the ‘Semana Anticorrupción’ (Anti–Corruption week)
in Lima, Peru.  After the fall of the Fujimori Presidency in 2001, the
extent of governmental corruption and its key players were being exposed, by means of documentation which demonstrated that members of Fujimori’s Cabinet had
accepted bribes, in addition to embezzling a great amount of money during
his presidency.  In this street action, members of Yuyachkani perform a
critique to the abuses of power and the financial corruption that took
place within Fujimori's government: the actors dance to the well-known ‘El baile
del Chino’ (a ‘tecnocumbia’ song used by Fujimori for his third
electoral campaign), wearing masks to represent some of these political
figures, including Fujimori, Montesinos, the Mayor, the Minister, a
Congresswoman, a representative of Judicial Power, the Assessor, Owners of
Mass-Communication, the Military and the Grupo Colina (a paramilitary
group).  The group toured around Lima in a small bus which they called
‘El Bus de la Fuga’ (‘Escape Bus’), from Barrios Altos (a neighborhood that suffered the murder to some of its residents) to La Cantuta (where a number of students
were murdered) to Tokyo (where President Fujimori fled to exile).  The
route covered both affluent and impoverished neighborhoods of Peru’s capital city
-including the Palacio de Justicia, the Distrito de Comas, the Parque
Universitario, the Universidad Nacional de Educación, Ate-Vitarte, Villa
el Salvador, and Miraflores- eliciting the most varied reactions depending
on where the street action was performed. Some of these street audience
reactions, along with footage of the performance, are documented in this video created by Miguel Piedra.

520 bb $a This play, directed by Teresa Ralli and created in collaboration with Ana
Correa, Rebecca Ralli and Lucia Lora in 1996, explores the interplay
between women’s subjective realm and the social sphere, in the line of
the broader ongoing investigation on women’s issues developed by the
female members of the Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. Three friends meet up
to cook and share a supper on the last day of the last year of the XXth
century, honoring a pact made twenty years before.  Only two of the
original three friends arrive (the third, a militant worker for human
rights, has been murdered); in her place, her daughter (played by Lucia
Lora) arrives to honor the pact made by her mother.  All three women are in
different stages in their lives.  The first character (played by Ana
Correa) was the top of her class in High School but, upon graduation, she
quickly married and had five kids who are her entire life now.  The second
character (played by Rebecca Ralli) realized her High School dreams by
becoming an artist, but stopped painting when she entered into a bad
marriage ten years after graduation.  The third character, the daughter of
the third friend, is resentful because, although her mother had time for
the rights of other children, she feels that she never had time for her. 
The three women revisit their lives and the moments they feel that changed
the course of their destiny.  They decide that this will be the first
supper (‘la primera cena’) of their new lives.  In the middle of
dinner, the ‘Goddess of the Kitchen’ appears (in this play, the kitchen
functions as a metaphor for life); the characters revalue the knowledge and
wisdom of women (in the context of the space of the kitchen), ultimately
inviting the audience to share their first supper with them by eating the
soup they were actually cooking on stage. Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

511 1b $a Ana Correa, lecturer/performer ; Miguel Rubio, commentator.
520 bb $a In this video, Ana Correa (one of the founding and still active members of
Peruvian theater ensemble Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani) demonstrates her
acting technique to a group of students, complemented with further commentary
by Yuyachkani’s artistic director Miguel Rubio. Correa believes that
the body is an actor's instrument; in this pedagogical demonstration she focuses on
her body work and her work with objects in the development of a character. 
Among the diverse elements of body work, Correa shows: the importance of
moving the body through space in different ways and at different speeds;
the importance of feeling your weight in the space; and how to make musical
‘phrases’ with your body, and how to play with the timing of the phrase
and manipulate it.  The demonstration also includes an example of how the
actress incorporates Tai-chi into her character development – Tai chi
being an important methodology for exploring and developing bodily
expressivity for Yuyachkani.  The lecture also includes mask work, as Ana
shows how the mask takes on its own identity, how the masked character
moves, and how it responds to various objects.  Correa also discusses
the balance between text work and body work.  One of the elements of body
work she demonstrates is dance, in particular the use of tap dance to learn
how to play with timing.  Ms. Correa goes over the creation of one of her
characters, ‘Po Po’ the clown.  Part of her methodology for creating
this character included playing with musical instruments (in the case of
‘Po Po’, an accordion), not only as instruments per se but also as performing
objects; special attention is paid to the exploration of how to
express emotions with and through them. Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

cultural heritage through theater, plastic/visual arts, dance and music, in
an effort to empower the community in the face of existing racism in the
country, at a time when the African cultural influence and the
Afro-Peruvian population was –and still is- looked down upon.  Yuyachkani
actress Ana Correa, director of the project, initiated this pedagogical and
activist effort inspired by the exploration of Peruvian cultural diversity
(including African influences in Peruvian music and dance) in
Yuyachkani’s renowned spectacle ‘Músicos Ambulantes.’ Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru.

520 bb $a Video documentation of 'Yourcenar, o Cada Quien su Marguerite,' a ‘sacred divertimento’ based on French writer Marguerite Yourcenar’s text ‘Qui n'a pas son Minotaure’, adapted and directed by Mexican theater and performance
artist Jesusa Rodríguez.  Inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus, Ariadne
and the Minotaur, the play poses a philosophical reflection on the desires,
repressions, dreams and sufferings of contemporary men and women.  The
triangle Ariadne-Theseus-Phaedra (performed by Paloma Woolrich, Juan Ibarra
and Claudia Lobo respectively), brings to the forefront dramatic conflicts
rooted in a series of dualities: sensual/spiritual, constructive/destructive,
idealist/pragmatic, male/female, to attack/to wait.  The performance, full
of poetic images, choreographic gestures, and mythic symbolism, renders the
Minotaur a metaphor of these conflicts (the ‘inner monsters’ of
humanity): each one of us, contemporary people, confronts our own inner
Minotaur. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

 Its founders, Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, created this queer
‘mockumentary’ as a parodic pseudo-ethnographic study of their renowned
venue in Mexico City.  Tracing its roots to the tradition of German cabaret
and analyzing the queer nuances of their creative work, the ‘Patronas’
thread footage from memorable performances performed at El Hábito: ‘El
Primer Fracaso,’ ‘Cachirulo para Adultos,’ ‘Homenaje a Cri-Cri,'
and ‘Juicio a Salinas,’ to name just a few.  The ongoing voice-over
commentary mocks the ultra-conservative view many Mexicans have of Rodríguez & Felipe's
ground-breaking work, considered a ‘perverse’ influence on Catholic,
right-wing conservative values and traditions.  This retrospective is a
testimony both to the trajectory and prolific work of Rodríguez and
Felipe, and to the kind of space El Hábito is: a hotbed for intellectuals,
feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who
want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

about their backgrounds, the origins of the band, and the ways their music
blends traditional Yup’ik songs with African-American musical influences
such as gospel, R&B, jazz and funk to create a unique new Native style.
They speak of their experience as urban natives and their relationship to
their roots —a relationship that for them has entailed a delicate process
of cultural negotiation between different traditions and generations. Among
other things, they discuss how they are viewed by the Yup’ik elders, what
problems are facing their communities and how they are called upon as new
culture bearers to revitalize Yup’ik identity among the youth.

511 0b $a Luisa Calcumil, interviewee ; Diana Taylor, interviewer.
520 bb $a Luisa Calcumil is a Mapuche actress, director and playwright from the South
of Argentina (Patagonia). She began her career as an actress in 1975. After
performing in twenty plays, five films and various television programs, she
felt she was not represented in the roles she played. So she decided to
write her own scripts: 'Hebras' and 'Es bueno mirarse en la propia sombra.' In
this interview, conducted by Diana Taylor at the Hemispheric Institute’s 5th Encuentro
(Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), Luisa begins by introducing herself in
Mapudungún (her indigenous language), saying, ‘I am a person of the
land, the land down south that our dear ancestors called Cold Swamp but is
now known as General Roca… With the protection of the Great Mother of the
Sky, the Great Father of the Sky, the Young Woman and the Young Man of the
Sky I have been able to arrive here today.’ She tells the story of her
difficult childhood and how she came to the world of theater. She also
discusses her solo performance, 'Es bueno mirarse en la propia sombra'
(‘It’s Good to See Ourselves in Our Own Shadow’), which she presented
at the Encuentro. Through her work, she wishes to transmit the Mapuche
worldview, which she says is different from that of ‘the white world’,
being mainly oral and musical. She wants to break with stereotypes of
indigenous peoples, who have been so widely represented by others; she
calls for self-representation, respect for traditions and the renewal of
hope for her community.

520 bb $a David Pleasant is a musical stylist who was raised in the Gullah/Geechee
culture of Georgia (Sapelo Island, Darien/McIntosh County and Savannah).
His work is driven by the wealth of African retention in Gullah culture,
particularly juba, hand jive, pattin', rhappin' and shout, which have
played a major role in the development of David's RiddimAthon!®, a
performance and teaching method developed from a synthesis of African,
Caribbean and African American musical traditions.  As a Fulbright Senior
Specialist, he presents international programs and lectures on the subject.
His work has been featured in theater, dance and television, and he was
featured in the award winning musical ‘Crowns’ by Regina Taylor. In
this interview, conducted by Tavia Nyong'o at the Hemispheric Institute’s 5th Encuentro
(Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), David talks about how he began playing
percussion, demonstrates the rhythms he uses in his work, and how these
shape daily Gullah life. These African-American beats include polyrhythm,
call & response, pitched hand claps, syncopation, improvisation, concurrent
percussion, and others that exist in much of American popular music. He
also discusses ‘Language of the Soul,’ the show he had performed at the
Encuentro a few days before the interview.

520 bb $a Dancing Earth is an array of indigenous dance artists who work as a
collective under the leadership of Rulan Tangen, striving to embody a
unique essence of Indigenous identity and perspective by creation and
renewal of artistic and cultural movement rituals. 'Ancient and futuristic,
our dances are an elemental language of bone and blood memory in motion. We
cultivate our individual artistry on behalf of empowerment of all peoples,
and create bridges for art and humanity, tradition and experimentation.
Through movement, we gather with respect, inspiration and innovation. We
create our works with Indigenous collaborators in the fields of music, mask
making, photography, costume, light design, architecture, poetry and
storytelling.' In this interview, conducted by Tina Majkowski at the Hemispheric
Institute’s 5th Encuentro (Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), choreographer
Rulan Tangen is joined by musician/dancer/painter Quetzal Guerrero
(Cambiva, Yacqui, Ahumeche), dancer/photographer Anthony Ch-Wl-Tas Collins
(Salt River Pima, Seneca, Osage), and dancer/actor/painter Alejandro Meraz
(Tarasco). They discuss, among other things, the origins of their
collaboration, the role of dance as a channel of empowerment for indigenous
people, and the ways in which Dancing Earth works with memory, place,
tradition, and ritual through movement.

520 bb $a Cabaret event by renowned artists Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, a
farewell gathering celebrating the 15-year trajectory of their Teatro Bar
El Hábito. The legendary performance venue was originally opened in 1954
by Mexican poet Salvador Novo as an agora for artistic expression. Acquired
and ran by Rodríguez and Felipe since 1990, El Hábito was transformed
into a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and
open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and
critical humor. Singing well-known songs by Felipe, reminiscing about events of the past 15 years, and
‘passing the torch’ to the new owners of the performance space (the
theater-cabaret ensemble Reinas Chulas -Ana Francis Mor, Cecilia Sotres,
Marisol Gasé, and Nora Huerta), Jesusa and Liliana celebrate the closing
of a period of their fruitful trajectory together, leaving us with a
provocative aphorism: ‘lo más difícil de quitarse es un hábito’. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

1993, and proceeded to preside over Bogotá as mayor for two eventful
terms. His surprising and often humorous initiatives tended to involve
grand gestures, often including local artists or personal appearances by
the mayor himself – taking a shower in a commercial about conserving
water, or walking the streets dressed in spandex and a cape as
Supercitizen. Mockus hired 20 mimes to control traffic and poke fun at
traffic violators – a program so successful that another 400 mimes were
quickly trained. He also initiated a ‘Night for Women,’ on which the
city's men were asked to stay home for an evening to look after the house
and the children. The city sponsored free open-air concerts, bars offered
women-only specials, and the city's women police were in charge of keeping
the peace. Under his leadership, Bogotá saw remarkable improvement across
the board – water usage dropped 40%, the homicide rate fell 70%, and
traffic fatalities dropped by over 50%, to mention only a few. In this
engaging keynote lecture at the Hemispheric Institute’s 5th Encuentro
(Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), Mockus surveys the audience and lays out
his definition of civic culture: the belief that people understand and
comply with social norms ‘por las buenas’ (obeying their conscience,
seeking social recognition, respecting the law) instead of ‘por las
malas’ (fearing punishment, ostracism or guilt).

511 0b $a Jesusa Rodríguez, interviewee ; Diana Taylor, interviewer.
520 bb $a Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer,
entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez moves seemingly
effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles,
and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge
traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from
elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian
indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative
acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the
body are constants in her productions. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and
her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and
consequences of power and its representation. In this interview the artist
comments on her particular use and transformation of the genre of
‘pastorela’ (Nativity play) in her cabaret performances, as a tool for
contesting political and religious fundamentalism in the Americas.  The
pastorelas, used by the Catholic Church as an evangelization tool during
the Conquest, are usually based on a clean-cut distinction between Good and
Evil, sustaining a binary thought that has fueled political, cultural and
religious agendas in the American hemisphere.  Rodríguez proposal to use
the pastorela genre against the ideologically conservative institutions
that originally introduced and used it, subversively mixes humor with
religion in order to contest the Manichean politics at play in contemporary
Western society.  Performances like ‘Concilio de Amor’ and ‘Pastorela
Terrorista’ are commented by the artist as examples of this performative
strategy, which Rodríguez links to a broader concern with civic
empowerment and education, issues of civil disobedience and popular
participation.

520 bb $a In this bilingual ‘pre-Hispanic’ cabaret performance, Jesusa Rodríguez
and Liliana Felipe perform some of their staple characters and songs, in a
satiric commentary on how US foreign policy, neoliberalism, and the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are affecting Latin America.
‘Freaka Kahlo,’ ‘la Serpiente Enchilada’ and the ‘Coatlicue’
are some of the queer ‘arquetypical’ characters performed by
Rodríguez; through ingenious neologisms and humorous wordplay, they pose a
critique to consumer society, repressive US policies against illegal
migrants, the imposition of transgenic corn in Mexico (which is currently
endangering the ecodiversity of native corn), and the opening of an American
megastore (the controversial Walmart) nearby the pre-Columbian pyramids of
Teotihuacán.  Renown songs by Felipe –‘Tienes que decidir,’
‘Mala,’ ‘El maíz,’ among others- provide a powerful antiphonal
commentary on these issues, bringing together the social and the personal
in a engaging take on queer politics.  The artists close the performance
with their famous song ‘Popocateptl,’ a parodic version of Mexican
composer José Pablo Moncayo’s most well-known work, ‘Huapango.’ Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico.

520 bb $a A Colombian mathematician, philosopher and politician, Antanas Mockus left
his post as vice-chancellor of Colombian National University in Bogotá in
1993, and proceeded to preside over Bogotá as mayor for two eventful
terms. His surprising and often humorous initiatives tended to involve
grand gestures, often including local artists or personal appearances by
the mayor himself – taking a shower in a commercial about conserving
water, or walking the streets dressed in spandex and a cape as
Supercitizen. Mockus hired 20 mimes to control traffic and poke fun at
traffic violators – a program so successful that another 400 mimes were
quickly trained. He also initiated a 'Night for Women,' on which the city's
men were asked to stay home for an evening to look after the house and the
children. The city sponsored free open-air concerts, bars offered
women-only specials, and the city's women police were in charge of keeping
the peace. Under his leadership, Bogotá saw remarkable improvement across
the board – water usage dropped 40%, the homicide rate fell 70%, and
traffic fatalities dropped by over 50%, to mention only a few. In this
interview, conducted by Doris Sommer at the Hemispheric Institute’s 5th Encuentro (Belo
Horizonte, Brazil, 2005), Mockus plays a game with his interviewer: in a
symbolic performance of 'social bonds,' they are linked to each other with
string and must figure out how to disentangle themselves through movement
(no cutting or untying), as they discuss civic culture and the ways
conflict can be resolved through the plurality of art.

520 bb $a Cabaret performance by Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, exploring the
downside of social indifference and the power of civil disobedience as an
effective form of civic participation through which to enact political,
cultural and social changes in the public sphere.  An anthropologist for
‘Discovery Chafa’ (a parody of ethnographic documentaries on American
television) researches a tribe of Latin American indigenous people, the
‘Yanomami’, joining them in a continental search for their lost gods. 
Western and Eastern cultures -characterized as representing ‘el Tener’
(to have) and ‘el Ser’ (to be), respectively- are represented as two
pseudo gods attempting to be recognized as the ‘universal’ Culture.
Countering this battle of wills, the piece propose (through satiric
eschatological dialogues and parodic twists) a rupture of the Manichean
East/West binary, favoring a ‘third option’, that of ‘Saber Estar’
(to know how to be in a place), attributed to native civilizations; this
option intends to open up a space for empowering and incorporating
indigenous people in contemporary national projects –projects which tend
to isolate them in discourses of Romantic myths of origin, while being
considered technologically and culturally ‘backward’.   Furthermore,
the artists invite the audience to have a critical approach not only to
foreign political and cultural agendas, but more urgently, to Mexico’s
current governmental agendas (among them, the effects of NAFTA on civil
society).  Civil disobedience is proposed as an effective tool for civic
participation; the audience is invited to join the ‘Enemigos de Fox’
club (a fictional opposition club against Mexican president Vicente Fox)
and to publicly express their discontent with the political and economic
situation of contemporary Mexico. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

520 bb $a Roughly edited video documentation of cabaret performance by renowned
artists Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe. ‘Juicio a Salinas’, a
mock trial of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari (president
of Mexico from 1988 to 1994) at the Teatro Bar El Hábito, is an invitation
to civic society to participate in a broader national call for
accountability to the Mexican government in the face of charges of
corruption, electoral fraud, embezzlement, and political violence. Using
humor and improvisation as a tool for starting a public dialogue, the
artists invite the audience to participate as a theatrical jury of
deputies; in this guise, the public has the opportunity to directly
question ‘Salinas’ (played by a cross-dressed Rodríguez) and
ultimately pass judgment on him, deciding whether or not to send him to the
Almoloya penitentiary.  Among protest chants of ‘El pueblo apoya, Salinas
a Almoloya’ (‘The people claim it, (send) Salinas to Alomloya’) and
the song ‘Solidaridad’ (‘propaganda theme song for Salinas’
controversial Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, PRONASOL), the piece is
proposed as a performative ‘propitiatory ritual’ for political justice,
rehearsing civic participation in Mexico’s public sphere. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones.

Mozart and Da Ponte's opera ‘Don Giovanni’, is a renowned feminist
rendition of the classic by Mexican theater company Divas A.C.  Directed by
Rodríguez and with musical direction by Alberto Cruzprieto, the play
successfully toured Latin America, the United States and Europe, receiving
much critical acclaim. ‘Donna Giovanni’ masterfully utilizes humor,
overlapping layers of cross-dressing, and the interplay between music,
wordplay and tableaux vivants in order to pose a feminist commentary on
sensuality, gender issues, and religious and cultural scenarios of love,
deceit, empowerment and desire.

520 bb $a Unedited video documentation of cabaret performance by renowned artists
Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe. ‘El ejido en Navidad’, in the
tradition of the yearly ‘pastorelas’ (Nativity plays) performed at
the Teatro Bar El Hábito in Mexico City, poses a satiric critique to
current political events in Mexico’s public sphere. Presented as a
fairytale-gone-wrong (presented by Cachirulo, legendary children’s TV
character by Enrique Alonso, and ‘betwitched’ by Cachirulo’s TV
characters Bruja Escaldufa and Fanfarrón), the piece poses an
anti-Establishment take on the agrarian reforms proposed by then President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari (through his controversial Ammendment to Article
27 of Mexico's Constitution). These reforms directly affected the
organizational units known as ‘ejidos’ –hence the Spanish pun between
‘el ejido’ (‘the ejido’) and ‘elegido’ (‘the Chosen One’, a
Christian epithet common in Nativity plays).  Corruption, embezzlement and
political violence roam rural Mexico while legendary political figures and
fictional characters visit an impoverished, disempowered peasant couple. 
The constant abuses, endured patiently by the peasantry and indigenous
peoples, evidence how political promises of progress and of inclusion in
the ‘national project’ end up as nightmares of oppression for millions
of Mexicans through history. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects.

She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation.

520 bb $a In this ‘political-poetical-philosophical-musical’ cabaret performance,
Jesusa Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe take on Mexico’s electoral climate
in order to pose a comment on ethics, politics, Mexican folklore and pop
culture.  Rodríguez populates the scenario of the ‘palenque’
(‘cockpit’, a place for popular gambling games like cockfighting) with
chameleonic characters Chona Schopenhauer (‘the only ranchera
philosopher’), Pita Amor (an old-fashioned, affected performer of poetry)
and Don Andrés Soler (a very macho, politically conservative old man),
among others, through which the artist criticizes the corruption and violence
associated with Mexico’s political climate.  In a ‘phenomenology of
fortuitous becoming', the universe is portrayed as 'a palenque where
anything could happen’, and Mexican electoral processes as a 'gamble'.  In
this vein, and interspersed with parodic renditions of traditional folk
songs by Rodríguez and ‘sexy ranchera’ Isela Vega (a famous Mexican
vedette),  the audience is invited to play a satirical Mexican
‘lotería’ (with cards like ‘The Wetback’, ‘The Zapatista’,
‘The First Lady’, and ‘The ATM’ substituting the traditional icons
of this popular game) and to gamble, control, and judge an electoral
‘cockfight’ where puppets of political candidates race to be the first
to reach the finishing line of Mexico's presidency. Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodréguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000. El Hábito (www.elhabito.com.mx) is a hotbed for intellectuals, feminists, gay rights activists and open-minded, progressive people who want to be engaged by a smart and critical humor. In this off-off space, and with the collaboration of their theater cooperative Las Divas, Jesusa y Liliana have produced hundreds of shows since the 1980s.

Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's
work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that
oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class.
In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the
close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the
military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the
normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. ‘Dykenstein’ is a
lesbian adaptation of the classic story of‘Frankenstein.'  In this
play, Dr. Dykenstein triumphantly creates ‘the perfect dyke,’ but one
of her assistants carelessly leaves the creature unattended in front of a
TV and a bunch of trashy magazines. Brainwashed by mainstream media, the
perfect dyke becomes a ‘wild’ straight woman. Desperate for a husband,
the monster threatens to murder Dr. Dykenstein if he does not make one for
her. ‘Dykenstein’ is a parody of the Christian Right’s take on
science, the U.S. anti-abortion crusade (which declared that having
aborting a fetus older than two weeks is murdering an American citizen),
and the rights of women.

In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the

normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. ‘Hamletango, Prince
of Butches’ is an adaptation of ‘Hamlet, Prince of Denmark’ for an
all-women’s cast.  In this play, all the original elements of
Shakespeare’s play appear rearranged, transformed.  Here, the prince is a
woman and the ghost is her mother. If in the original drama the ghost of
the father comes back asking his son for revenge, causing a
tragedy where everybody dies, in this version the ghost of the mother does
not come back asking for revenge.  Ophelia appears here as a good swimmer,
but the audience still witness her funeral –and so does she, next to
the
other characters, bringing together the living and the dead, ghosts and
ashes.  The tragedy, then, becomes a comedy.  At the end of the
drama
–as in the original ‘Hamlet’- a group of clowns comes to tell ‘what
really happened.' Represented as peasants who just witnessed the death of
the whole royal family in the hands of each other, the clowns find
themselves in a palace full of clothes, food, and wine, without a King, a
Queen, or a Prince.  So they dress with their clothes, drink their wine,
and celebrate.

In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the
close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the
military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the
normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. ‘100 years of
Attitude’ mocks the title of the Latin American novel 'One Hundred Years
of Solitude' by Gabriel García Márquez. The play approaches the theme of
execution, imperialism, invasion, and colonialism making several explicit
references to the war in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and the
official discourse of the US president George W. Bush's administration regarding the role of the United States
in the international context. The play talks about the end of the world as
a subjective experience, that is captured in the following sentence:
‘When everybody around you is dying… that's the end of the world.’
In the piece, a Christian executioner prays before killing and an American
family comes to live in town taking over the local homes. The people of
this fictional lesbian town are executed several times, always coming back
to life; the life of a community prevails over that of the individual. Some
other themes that appear in the show, that are a constant in Cook’s work,
are the theme of the ‘Hero -through references to Odysseus- and the
corrupting effect of power.

normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. ‘The Fraud’ was
performed after the 2000 controversial elections in the United States. The play
addresses the rights that were lost under the Bush administration, when most
of the social services were cut off and the poor and marginalized lost the
basic support that kept them alive. In the play, the characters experience
feelings of loss and confusion.  They end up not knowing if they ever had
what they think they have lost.  The audience is invited to put 25 cents,
and a black woman will die, right there, in front of them.  During the rest
of the scenes, the characters experience apathy, fear, and desperation
while dealing with all the dead bodies around them. In the last scene, they
‘represent’ the people from Third-World countries; the ones who were
not called to vote, but that will be affected by the measures enforced by
the president of the United States.  Because US policies will affect their
lives deeply, they claim their right to vote.

Cook performs playing a guitar. The solo piece was inspired by a
commentary by a famous baseball player that Susana saw on TV, in which the
player presented homeruns as 'a God-giving thing.' In the monologue,
Susana humorously locates this 'gift' in inadequate contexts like
Argentina, where baseball is not a popular sport like in the United States; and she
also imagines a female protagonist who, despite her talent, would not make
it to the major league because of her gender. 'Homerun' was part of
'Rivers of Honey, Women's of Color Cabaret,' held at WOW Theatre Café in New York City.

presented at WOW Café and at Dixon Place a week before the Senate of the
United States discussed an amendment to the Constitution that would
ban the marriage of gay and lesbian couples. The amendment didn’t pass,
but some conservative Republicans announced that they will restart the
discussion after a month. ‘The Idiot King’ is about the Sanctity of
Marriage and policy making.  In the play the Idiot King and his Court
discuss several issues affecting the world like Satan, global warming, the
sanctity of marriage, abortion, and evil.  The discussions are embedded
within Christian religiosity, biased logic, and irony. The parody includes
real quotes from some of the ruling discourse, making it difficult to tell
them apart from the jokes.

520 bb $a Susana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist.
 Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's
work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that
oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class.
In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the
close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the
military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the
normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. ‘The Values Horror
Show’ was written as a response to the 2004 US election campaign ran by
the Neo-conservatist agenda that claimed to protect ‘family values’ and
‘the sanctity of marriage.’  While proclaiming themselves as defenders
of traditional values in America, the Neo-conservatists did not intervene
in matters of murder, war, poverty, and genocide that came along. The show
starts with a war. Two armies are fighting for God and they have similar
prophets and commandments. It is confusing who is fighting in what army.
During the show, the soldiers become the workers who end up confronting
Lady Incorporated, a character that represents capitalism. Throughout the
play, Cook interweaves American traditional values with the current
policies against ethnic minorities other marginalized sectors of American society.

is a solo performance about memory and the borders of life. 'Spic' is the
ethnic slur applied to Latinos and Hispanics in the US. In the piece, which
explores the borders between the 'inner' and the 'outer' world,
death appears as just one more element of life. The show is organized in a
series of monologues that describe the character’s journey in search of
God, Truth, Justice, Friends, True Love, and True Gender. The protagonist
ends up finding the frontiers of the social body, looking for a job, trying
to survive in a corporate world. Includes Cook's 'Lemon Cookies' Monologue.

In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the

normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. During his
administration, Rudolph Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, decided that
he was going to ‘exterminate’ the rats from New York City.  In
‘Rats’ Susana Cook used some of Giuliani’s discourse to compare it
with the fantasy that some people have to make gays and lesbians disappear;
the fantasy that those in power have that they can exterminate and rend any
minority group invisible.  'Rats' is about queers, butches, lesbians, and
a little bit about rats.  The show has a non linear structure. The piece
starts with a comparison between rats and King Hamlet. The main character
realizes that she already became a ghost- even when she is not dead yet-
and she starts obsessing about her ghost and her death. She states:
'sometimes your death can be more important than your life'.

520 bb $a Drew Hayden Taylor (www.drewhaydentaylor.com) is an Ojibwa author, humorist
and playwright from Curve Lake Reserve Ontario, Canada.  In this interview,
Taylor talks about his use of humor, the way he feels about using Native
issues in his work, and they way his work is received in different
communities.  He also addresses writing from an Aboriginal perspective for
a broader non-Native audience.  By analyzing the use of Native humor in his
pieces, he breaks down the universal language of his plays.  Within the
larger context of Aboriginal Theater, Drew looks at the development of his
works as an offshoot of the work of people such as Thompson Highway and
feels that he is able to go beyond the early works in this area that are
primarily dark and depressing.   Finally, Taylor rhapsodizes about the
future of Native Theater and the translation of the classics such as
Chekhov into Aboriginal settings.

520 bb $a Shortly after the opening of his show, ‘Revealing the Absent Indian,’
part of the ‘New Tribes New York’ series at the National Museum of the
American Indian, Alan Michelson talks about the exhibit, which is a
retrospective of his work.  Much of his art has been informed by the fact
that his was adopted out (Native people were adopted out in alarming rates
in the 1940's through the 1970's) and only met his Mohawk family later in
life.  Michelson frames this issue within the larger subject of Native
displacement.  Another theme of his work is the landscape, which the artist
uses to challenge the notions of supremacy and superiority.    One of the
pieces Alan concentrates on, ‘Two Row II,’ is a video installation
which references the Two Row Wampum Belt that symbolizes the agreement
under which the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee (the Six nations confederacy which
Mohawk are a part of) welcomed the white peoples to their lands: 'We will
NOT be like father and son, but like brothers. These TWO ROWS will
symbolize vessels, traveling down the same river together.  One will be for
the Original People, their laws, their customs, and the other for the
European people and their laws and customs. We will each travel the river
together, but each in our own boat. And neither of us will try to steer the
other's vessel.'  The Haudenosaunee has kept the agreement to this date. Alan's artwork is also in the film and his show can be seen at http://www.nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/newtribe/.

260 bb $a New York, New York, United States : $c 2006 June 7.
508 bb $a Nanobah Becker (Navajo), videographer.
511 0b $a Chris Eyre (Southern Cheyenne), interviewee ; Andrew McLean (Inupik), interviewer.
520 bb $a In this interview, filmmaker Chris Eyre (www.chriseyre.org) talks the
reasons why he went into filmmaking, his early years as a filmmaker at NYU,
and the influence he felt this educational foundation had on his work.
Chris also reminisces about his early career, at a time when independent
film was still a force in the media world, and the burgeoning Native film
community that sprung up during this period. The discussion leads to
Eyre’s landmark film ‘Smoke Signals’ and the direction the success of
the film took him personally and professionally.  The success of this film
lead the artist to a feeling of greater responsibility to represent and to
gain knowledge about other tribes since he became an involuntary
spokesperson for Native people. As a filmmaker at the beginning of his career, interviewer Andrew McLean
(Inupik) directed several questions to Eyre about negotiating the film
world as a minority producer. Chris acknowledged the existing pressures to
be ‘issue oriented’ and stated that the fact that a Native person was
on film makes it a political piece.  Eyre reflects on some of his films
such as ‘Skins’ (which he made to illustrate the poverty on the Pine
Ridge reservation, and consequently did not have a successful run), and
contrasted it with his character-driven films such as ‘Smoke Signals’
and ‘Edge of America,’ which have a more universal appeal. Finally
Chris relays Andrew, who come form a whaling Nation, his excitement about
an upcoming project on the Makah Whale hunt that took place in May 17, 1999
at Neah Bay.

A prolific playwright and theater director, Buenaventura discusses his most influential contribution to Latin American experimental theater, ‘creación colectiva’ (‘collective creation’); he also comments on the trajectory of the TEC, one of the most important Latin American theater groups, founded by Enrique in 1954. In a dialogue with interviewer Martinez and Colombian actor Lisímaco Núñez, Buenaventura poses a commentary on the interplay between art and politics, the nuances and differences between notions of ‘popular’ vs. ‘populist’ theater, and the role and limits of art criticism; taking into account the works by Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino, the artist also discusses the aesthetic and political points of contact between Chicano and Colombian theater.

theater scholar Alma Martinez.  In this interview, Jaqueline talks about
her passage from her native France to Colombia with her husband (TEC’s
founder Enrique Buenaventura), her life as a theater artist, her
collaborative process with Buenaventura, and the influences of her
international and Colombian experiences in shaping her unique directing
style.  Collective creation is discussed, paying special attention to
considerations of space, the dialogue between the dramatic text and the
actors, and the presence of myths in theater plays; Vidal has always felt
passionate for the spatial, non-verbal communication between people and how
these elements shape a theater capable of making the everyday shake,
rendering the invisible visible, and opening a space for imagination, for
the possibility of living in an alternative, organic world in a time where
fragmentation permeates social interaction.  In conversation with Martinez,
the artist discusses the aesthetic and political points of contact between
Chicano and Colombian theater.  Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino’s
interplay between ‘wonderful theater’ and ‘responsible politics’,
argues Vidal, has been influential to the joint efforts by prestigious
Colombian theater practitioners to bridge their artistic and political
practices through collaboration, the organization of festivals, joint
seminars, etc.  Issues of mestizaje, art, politics and gender are also
discussed by Vidal, paying special attention to the role and participation
of women in Latin American and Latino theater and their relationship to
feminist struggles.

workshops. Named after the Hopi goddess Spiderwoman, who taught the people
to weave, the sisters write and perform stories through what they call
‘storyweaving’, their technique of creating storytelling theatrical
pieces through text, movement, music, visual images, and song. As a part of
Indian Summer 2006 in The Circle, Spiderwoman performs one-woman works by
Gloria Miguel, Lisa Mayo, and Muriel Miguel (respectively), as well as
storyweaving material developed as an ensemble. This was one of the last
performances to be held at the renowned AICH venue at 404 Lafayette, and
therefore an emotional piece and an homage to the long and fruitful
relationship between Spiderwoman Theater and the American Indian Community
House (www.aich.org).

Award, they are also members of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance
and Politics, Danza Celtiliztli Nauhcampa, the New York Zapatistas and the
American Indian Community House. The company's plays and workshops address
social, political, cultural and identity issues that impact their lives and
their community. Coatlicue’s work is based on stories they weave
together, educating as well as entertaining while reaffirming their
survival as urban Native American women. ‘Holding Up the Sky’ is a
series of theater skits addressing issues of borders and immigration at
work in indigenous communities, ranging from the grotesque to the poignant,
from the deeply personal to global issues devastating their communities. 
Distinctive elements of this performance are the use of humor in
storytelling and the participation of audience members to ‘hold up the
sky’ as inspired by Mayan mythology. Muriel Miguel (Spiderwoman Theater)
contextualizes this event by talking about Coatlicue’s long relationship
with the American Indian Community House (www.aich.org), and the fact that this ‘Indian

and the Laugh Resort. Dawn is also a comedy writer and has written for the
stage, radio, film and television; her work has been featured on APTNs
Buffalo Tracks and CBC Radio. Dumont’s comedy style has been described as
a coy smile covering a killer wit. Dawn is a Plains Cree born and raised in
Saskatchewan, Canada; her reserve, the Okanese First Nation, is quite
possibly the smallest reservation in the world. This is her first time
performing at the American Indian Community House (www.aich.org). She tells
‘anecdotes’ from her home reservation in Saskatchewan and here recent
move to New York, joking about common problems Native people face in the
city, such as being mistaken for other races.  Dawn Dumont’s humor is
representative of the way in which Native people utilize humor as a coping
mechanism and a tool for political commentary.

director, theorist, playwright, and founder of renowned Colombian theater
ensemble Teatro La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co), conducted by
Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez.  In this extensive interview,
García discusses key topics germane to his artistic work, narrating his
first experiences in theater, the artistic trajectory of La Candelaria
(founded in 1966, and still one of the most important theater groups in
Latin America), and his personal take on popular theater, collective
creation, the influence of Brechtian theories in his artistic work, the
role of the director in collaborative artistic collectives, and the state
of the scenic arts in Colombia in the context of economic and political
crisis.  Santiago also comments on the influences and points of contact
between Latin American and Latino theaters based on his personal
experiences traveling and working with different theater groups, including
the Chicano theater ensemble El Teatro Campesino; under the rubric of the
‘popular’, García analyzes the artistic affinities and ideological
choices present in collective creation across the Americas.  Finally, the
artist share his thoughts on La Candelaria’s rendition of ‘El
Quijote’, based on García’s personal adaptation of this literary
masterpiece. A carnivalesque mixture of cultures and traditions, this play
highlights shared traits between the Spanish novel and Colombian culture,
while performing a commentary on illusions, fantasy and utopia, elements
that the author finds absent in present-day Colombia.

ensemble Teatro La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co), conducted by
Chicano theater scholar Alma Martinez.  In this extensive interview,
García discusses key topics germane to his artistic work, narrating his
first experiences in theater, the artistic trajectory of La Candelaria
(founded in 1966, and still one of the most important theater groups in
Latin America), and his personal take on popular theater, collective
creation, the influence of Brechtian theories in his artistic work, the
role of the director in collaborative artistic collectives, and the state
of the scenic arts in Colombia in the context of economic and political
crisis.  Santiago also comments on the influences and points of contact
between Latin American and Latino theaters based on his personal
experiences traveling and working with different theater groups, including
the Chicano theater ensemble El Teatro Campesino; under the rubric of the
‘popular’, García analyzes the artistic affinities and ideological
choices present in collective creation across the Americas.  Finally, the
artist share his thoughts on La Candelaria’s rendition of ‘El
Quijote’, based on García’s personal adaptation of this literary
masterpiece. A carnivalesque mixture of cultures and traditions, this play
highlights shared traits between the Spanish novel and Colombian culture,
while performing a commentary on illusions, fantasy and utopia, elements
that the author finds absent in present-day Colombia.

theater ensemble in 1982; originally based in Bogota, the Teatro Itinerante
del Sol later moved to the rural village of Villa de Leyva in search of a
connection with nature and the development of a creative space for their
work.  In this interview, Beatrice discusses her artistic trajectory; in
terms of the Teatro Itinerante del Sol, Camargo talks about the centrality
of myths, dreams, rituals, and masks in their theater work.  Defined by the
artist as ‘biodrama’, her theater pieces are conceived as explorations
on myth and collective memory. Camargo also comments on how her theater
projects, through the interplay between the mythical and the historical,
address political issues of women and of indigenous peoples in
Colombia.

to the exploration and denunciation of women’s issues in Colombia.  Under
the rubric of ‘the personal is political’, La Máscara aspires to be a
tool for historical change through social engagement; in this line,
Bolaños and her ensemble work with marginalized populations (women,
youth), give workshops, teach, and collectively create plays addressing
issues of sexuality, domestic violence, homophobia, machismo, political
violence, etc.  Collaboration is a key strategy throughout their artistic
trajectory, having worked with other renowned women in Colombian theater
(such as Patricia Ariza and Jacqueline Vidal) and with the international

Project, among others. Furthermore, Bolaños comments on the aesthetic and
political points of contact between Colombian and Chicano theaters, and
talks about several plays in La Máscara’s repertoire.

Chicano theater, especially in relation to the work of Luis Valdez and
El Teatro Campesino.  Issues of Latino and Latin American identity and
solidarity are discussed, as well as the limits and possibilities of
political theater as a tool for aesthetic exploration and social
intervention.  Mario also comments on the aesthetic coordinates of street
theater, characterizing the work in Teatro Taller as one devoted to the
creation of a 'text of images' through choreography of movement; he considers
this type of performance to be political, but with a different language,
one that broadens the theater audience and addresses current sociopolitical
issues in new expressive ways.  As a big discipline with different branches
and traditions that can contribute and enrich one another, street theater
has inspired Teatro Taller (www.teatrotallerdecolombia.com) to create and
produce the Festival Internacional de Teatro Callejero al Aire Puro
(‘Open Air International Street Theater Festival’) in Colombia. 
Matallana comments on the importance of this effort in the context of the
trajectory of Teatro Taller; furthermore, he talks about some of the plays
in their repertoire (‘Génesis’, ‘Las sombras del olvido’), paying
special attention to how their aesthetic as a street performance troupe has
developed -influenced by international artistic collaboration- over the

solidarity are discussed, as well as the limits and possibilities of
political theater as a tool for aesthetic exploration and social
intervention.  Mario also comments on the aesthetic coordinates of street
theater, characterizing the work in Teatro Taller as one devoted to the
creation of a 'text of images' through choreography of movement; he considers
this type of performance to be political, but with a different language,
one that broadens the theater audience and addresses current sociopolitical
issues in new expressive ways.  As a big discipline with different branches
and traditions that can contribute and enrich one another, street theater
has inspired Teatro Taller (www.teatrotallerdecolombia.com) to create and
produce the Festival Internacional de Teatro Callejero al Aire Puro
(‘Open Air International Street Theater Festival’) in Colombia. 
Matallana comments on the importance of this effort in the context of the
trajectory of Teatro Taller; furthermore, he talks about some of the plays
in their repertoire (‘Génesis’, ‘Las sombras del olvido’), paying
special attention to how their aesthetic as a street performance troupe has
developed -influenced by international artistic collaboration- over the
years.

evolution of its dramaturgy, the development of the technique of
‘creación colectiva’ (collective creation), and the role of TEC’s
director Enrique Buenaventura in the realm of Latin American theater theory
and practice.  Among the many influences that have shaped the artistic
endeavors of TEC, Fernández points to the importance of Brechtian
theories, as well as the strong cross-pollination between their work and
that of Chicano theater, primordially the works by Luis Valdez and El Teatro
Campesino.  The actor then poses an assessment on the scope and limits of

performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their
communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women’s
and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and
education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'Amores en el
barranquito' is a tale about a young couple in love 
and how the way they live their lives (especially the woman's
following of her husband's desires without being able to question them) leads
them into hardship. As the play develops the situation worsens when the
couple’s children grow up: their future is jeopardized, for
there are too many family members to take care of. The play acts as an invitation to
reflect on issues of family planning and how responsible planning could ensure that
each family member gets access to food and education.

desconchada' tells the story of Conchita, an elderly woman in search of a
home. The word- play in the title references the lack of shelter that the
protagonist, Conchita, suffers after she is thrown out of the house that
she shares with her daughter and her husband (in Spanish  the word 'concha'
means 'shell' and the prefix ‘des’ means ‘deprived.’) The piece
narrates Conchita's  pilgrimage from a small town to the city, to which she
arrives in search of her son, who rejects her. She then meets a woman
who offers her a job as a caretaker of her father. Finally, it is Conchita's
granddaughter who takes care of her and brings her back to Conchita's son's
house as she is thrilled to learn about her roots and to re-connect with
her community.

who invites them to rebel by playing a trick on the landowners. She then

theater as a tool for education and community building. They are
performers, playwrights, and teachers who tour their work in their
communities and internationally, performing plays that focus on women’s
and indigenous rights, literacy, cultural survival, ecology, health, and
education in the Tzeltal and Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'El mundo al
revés' is a children’s play that includes live percussion, singing, and
masks. In this allegoric play, the moon gives birth to a group of children
whose well-intentioned actions make the world an ideal place to live in.
The moon also gives birth to the devil who curses the world and changes
everything for the worse. Because people get organized and help each
other, they finally defeat the devil and his dragon. The aftermath of the
devil’s death is a beautiful day in which a series of rights are honored
and enjoyed -land, health, education, work, housing, etc.

experienced by a man from a small town who, despite the fact that his wife
does not follow him, decides to try his luck in the city. The play narrates the
hard life of this man in the city, where people are involved in fraud but also where he is helped by strangers. He finally meets a woman and commits to her,
denying the existence of his former wife; he finds comfort in his new
family and even builds a successful business.

tackles the issues that result from an increasingly common phenomenon in
which indigenous people leave their subsistence farms in order to seek
higher paying jobs in nearby cities. The loss of support from communities,
the racism and discrimination indigenous people face in the cities, and the
disintegration of relationships in the face of new hardships are all themes
explored within the play. The performance is followed by a Q & A.

fuerza de la mujer' presents the role of women in electoral politics. Don
Zacarías and Doña Carmelita are the two candidates that are competing to
represent the people in the upcoming elections. Zacarías' relationship with
his prospective voters is patronizing and disrespectful, while Carmelita
has closer ties with the women in the community, a relationship that
includes open dialogue and empowerment. Through a flashback, the play
narrates how Carmelita, from being part of a family who did not allow her
to get an education, became a political leader following her strong will.
She ends up winning the elections and the rest of the women are inspired by
her example to demand their right for equality, education, and political
participation and leadership.

introduces her head into a plastic bag filled with water and then tapes it
tightly onto her neck. She then sits down upright with the bag on her head.
The action creates a real and urgent situation that the artist has to
respond to. It ends when Nao, after a minute and twenty seconds, gets free
from the water- bag finally breathing like a fish out of water.

performances that commemorated the 500 anniversary of the conquest of
America. The title mixes the term 'indigenous' with 'burrito', the name of
the famous Mexican wrap. In the performance, Bustamante challenged the
white men in the audience to go onstage to express their apologies for the
years of oppression of indigenous peoples by eating a piece of a burrito that
Bustamante had strapped on to her hips. With humor and sarcasm, Bustamante
addressed the issues that the 500-year commemoration brought to collective
attention. Her piece also denounces how art institutions forced artists to
pay tribute to the date if they wanted to get funding.

theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San
Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights,
and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally,
performing plays that focus on women’s and indigenous rights, literacy,
cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and
Tzotzil indigenous languages. ‘El Dueño de las Mariposas’ tells the
story of Chepe, an orphan predestined by his ‘wayjel’ –the
hummingbird- to change the fate of the slaves suffering under the despotic
rule of coffee plantation landowner Don Martín Contreras.  The play
exposes the dreadful life and work conditions of the ‘cafetaleros’
(coffee plantation workers), denouncing human right violations and
demanding the observance of the fundamental rights of the individual. This
piece is the result of a process of collective creation on the relationship
between politics and the body; the resulting performance brings together
symbols, characters and circumstances form the rich Mayan imaginary as well
as from the everyday life conditions of indigenous peoples in Latin
America, in intricate labyrinths of time, love, injustice, and freedom, an
urgent call for inalienable human rights.

520 bb $a Handheld footage of Coney Island’s 2005 Circus Amok’s show ‘Princess:
The Tail of a Lost City’, a queer political performance on city planning
and housing policy.  The exploits of Bluetessa and Squeemish take us on a
quest for affordable housing in NYC, in a legal/magical battle between
President Bush’s 2005 executive order on Eminent Domain and the civil
society’s proposal of the Tenant Empowerment Act. Issues of civic
representation in governmental processes spark interactive audience
participation, proposing ‘candidates’ for the Supreme Court and calling
the Mayor’s Office of Operations demanding mandatory inclusionary zoning.
Trolls, felines, evil developers, jugglers and acrobats all come together
to educate, activate and entertain, in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic
artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is
a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide
free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the
people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group
has been together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy,
political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city.
Over the years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking,
juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning- have been combined with
experimental dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and
gender-bending performance art and improvisational techniques, creating new
meanings for circus while continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages
throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the
audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community
interaction while enjoying a queer celebratory spectacle.

520 bb $a Performed at renowned NYC performance venue P.S. 122, ‘Spies R Us’ is
Circus Amok’s second show. Through a carnivalesque ‘film noir’
aesthetic, the piece poses a satiric critique of US foreign (and homeland
security) policy, in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric
skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. The overarching theme of
espionage points to conflicting relationships between ‘special agents’
of government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and
issues of distortion and disinformation, imperialism, bigotry, violence,
paranoia and political impunity.  The play is an open call to be informed
of current events and to defend and empower civic activism in the face of
governmental conflictive agendas. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based

alternative medicine, the historical portrayal of medicine products through
racist propaganda, mortality, worldwide epidemics, and health insurance.

in NYC at the turn of the millennium.  Police brutality, privatization, and
excessive construction of corporate and commercial buildings in former

performed at Coney Island in NYC in 2003. The piece ponders the political
agendas of the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, created in response to the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and a key government department
linked to the ‘War on Terror’.  The performance discusses issues of
selective profiling, surveillance, threats to citizenship, and other
breaches of privacy in the public and privates spheres of civil society,
enacted by the government in the name of ‘patriotism’ and
‘security’.  The troupe renders a satirical take on military euphemisms
(by the Dame Divas of Military Deconstruction), as well as on the
presidency of George W. Bush (through the sing-along picture Ballad of
Georgio Bushwack), while advocating for civic critical thinking and a
collective demand for a broader sense of security –food, shelter, health
care, good art- in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric
skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City

revolves around the topic of environmental pollution and its subsequent

repercussions. A ‘lack of protection’ is exposed through the
denunciation of related environmental issues like the greenhouse effect,

initially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s,
when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory
of the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women’s
ensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues.
Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to this
mission, despite the many social and economic pressures they’ve had to
endure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantly
seeks to ‘invisibilize’ their work. Because of their fruitful
stubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also
working with marginalized communities, actively participating in political
protests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of
theater festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women’s role
in the construction of a peaceful Colombia.

workplaces, which are living the anguish of waiting for their disappeared
family members. We see the woman in her private space, as she performs
mundane tasks; as the character attempts to stay engrossed in her
housework, traumatic memories of violent events -recorded in her body- are
repeated time and again. Lodged in her body, the scars of violence, death,
and terror inevitably puncture every gesture, every task. When the
character does speak, it is a fragmented collage of commonplace phrases
mixed with texts from Rodoreda, Galeano, Borges, Vestrini, and actual
testimonies from the families of the disappeared. The actions of the
character rise above the silence and make us witnesses of a world plagued
by fear, where hope and courage are the unique materials of survival.
Teatro La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women’s theater in
Colombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater
initially comprised of male and female actors; by the early 1980s, when
only the women wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group,
Lucy Bolaños decided to make it a women’s ensemble fully dedicated to a
feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social
change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and
economic pressures they’ve had to endure in an environment plagued by
violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to ‘invisibilize’ their
work; La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but also working
with marginalized communities, actively participating in political protests
and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization of theater
festivals. Through their work, they keep re-thinking women’s role in the
construction of a peaceful Colombia.

'Casa Matriz', a one-act play for two actresses written by Argentine
playwright and cartoonist Diana Raznovich, is the story of a search for the
perfect mother. Bárbara is turning 30, and as a (very expensive) gift to
herself, she decides to hire a ‘substitute mother’ from a very unique
agency, Casa Matriz. This agency -a bizarre mothering equivalent of an
escort service- specializes in delivering fully customized mothers-for-a
day to their clients, who shape their ideal matriarch by filling out a form
detailing their every emotional need, all the desired characteristics, and
the perfect scenario. Using the technique of ‘theatre inside of
theatre’, this comedy provokes laughter and the immediate reflection of
the emotional relations between mothers and daughters. It investigates
interpersonal communications of everyday people, and critiques the
problematic system of family structure.

melting, drought, pollution, conservation, etc. Objects, bodies, and a

hair, legends of the long hair of ancestral feminine characters like
Medusa, Lady Godiva, Mary Magdalene, among others.  The piece questions the
tradition of patriarchal thought which depicts women’s bodies as
incarnations of evil; with the complicit help of science, religion, law,
art and marketing, the symbolic damnation of women has been perpetuated,
reinforced by new, contemporary myths.  The ambivalent depiction of the
feminine throughout history –as a muse, an object, a mother, a temptress,
an angel, a witch- positions the feminine in a paradoxical crossroads of
misogyny and idealization, rendering women a disempowered ‘Other’. The
piece poses a feminist commentary on these misogynist practices, using a
meta-theatrical approach to the stories of famous feminine icons to
denounce the injustices inflicted on them, and to celebrate their power and
agency as women. La Máscara is the oldest feminist, all-women’s theater

performance about sexuality from a feminine point of view. Four women meet
at a bar, sharing their romantic and erotic dreams and stories between
drinks, love letters, and pop quiz questions on love and sex. Abandoning
traditional social certainties in order to explore personal doubts and
contradictions, the characters submerge in the subjectivity of their
consciences, setting free their instincts, sensuality, beauty, pleasure.

520 bb $a ’Bocas de bolero’ is a collective creation by Teatro La Máscara on the
relationships women have with everyday activities in the domestic realm.
The melodrama of marriage, the notion of waiting, domestic chores,
religion, mother-daughter relationships, gender conventions, etc., are
woven with the romantic and melancholy sounds and themes of bolero. Through
a polysemic treatment of space, reiteration, movement and image that
explores the dynamics of memory, personal present and collective past, the
performance artfully confronts the taboos, conventions and struggles
surrounding cultural notions of gender. Teatro La Máscara is the oldest
-and one of the only- feminist, all-women’s theater in Colombia. Founded
in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theater initially comprised of
male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s, when only the women
stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectory of the group, Lucy
Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women’s ensemble fully dedicated
to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues. Committed to feminism and social
change, they have stayed true to this mission, despite the many social and
economic pressures they’ve had to endure in an environment plagued by
violence and machismo, which constantly seeks to ‘invisibilize’ their
work. Because of their fruitful stubbornness, La Máscara is not only
creating and staging plays, but also working with marginalized communities,
actively participating in political protests and demonstrations, and being
involved in the organization of theater festivals. Through their work, they
keep re-thinking women’s role in the construction of a peaceful
Colombia.

Maria M. is driven to madness (we find her in a psychiatric ward) and

Adelia’ portrays the adolescent world in a religious school, where young
women are taught the cultural expectations of division of roles between men

critique to women’s passive acceptance of a gendered ‘destiny’

Melting’, ‘Some People’, and ‘Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop’ have
garnered many awards including 2 OBIES, a NEA Solo Theatre Fellowship,
Sundance Writers Fellowship, CalArts/Alpert Award In Theatre and a
Tennessee Williams Fellowship. He is a Senior Fellow at the New School’s
Vera List Center For Art & Politics and his writings on hip-hop, race and
class have appeared in ‘The Village Voice’ and ‘New York Times’,
among others; his book ‘Jails, Hospitals & Hip-Hop’ is in its second
printing by Villard Books/Random House. Mr. Hoch also founded the
‘Hip-Hop Theater Festival’ in 2000 which has since presented over 75
hip-hop generation plays from all over the world. A third-generation New
Yorker who grew up during the birth of Hip-Hop culture in a multiracial
outer-borough neighborhood, Danny brings together his inner monologues,
layered composites of stories and voices form his personal experiences,
stories of his community and his generation, placing traditionally
peripheral characters center stage. Characters like radio personality
Caribbean Tiger, Jamaican dancehall entertainer Madman, tenement building
handyman Kazmierczack, ‘cool’ teenagers Floe and Flex, straight-outta-Jersey
pseudo-yuppie Bill, fast-paced disc jockey Al Capón, young office worker
Blanca, and César, a middle-aged man at his first visit to a therapist,
all evidence this outstanding contemporary work, reunited under the title
‘Some People’, here performed at Performance Space 122 in New York
City. An urban griot for the communities of urban North America, Hoch
combines Hip-Hop’s worldview and expressive strategies of resistance,
along with storytelling riffs, actively exploring language in order to move
the audience from being passively entertained to become actively
engaged.

520 bb $a ‘Guinnaru’ tells the story of a water spirit coming from Africa to the
Pacific coast of Colombia. It elaborates on short stories from an anthology
of African oral tradition by Swiss poet and novelist Blaise Cendrars. The
play’s three parts –‘Mbongo’, ‘Entremés del Muerto’, ‘El
Munú del Falemé’ - are woven by multiple narrators that sing and tell a
series of tales on the intricate relationships between gods, humans and
animals. The play merges classic theatrical language with music, dance,
acrobatics, masks and colorful costumes in a theatrical exploration of
African modes of representation and expression; Black Africans constitute
one of the ethnic groups of Colombia and TEC has always tried to rescue and
redeem the roots of Colombian national identity. Teatro Experimental de
Cali (TEC) is a collective of playwrights, actors, dancers, musicians,
stage designers and students committed to the exploration and creation of
new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by
Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental
de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic
and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived
and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the field is their
method of ‘creación colectiva’ (‘collective creation’), in which
all the participants of the play –including the audience- become involved
with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite of this stress on
collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main poet and
playwright, who developed most of TEC’s texts and directed the majority
of their plays. While TEC’s works address various historical and social
issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political
radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and
culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular
appeal.

520 bb $a One of TEC's plays devoted to historical reconstruction as a work of fiction.
The action is located in Haiti right after the French Revolution. Letizia,
Napoleon’s mother, tells the audience the marvelous deeds of her beloved
son and the love conquests of her most beautiful daughter, Paulina.
Josephine, Napoleon’s wife, comes to Haiti from her exile in Martinica
and introduces the political issues of Caribbean islands. Then Napoleon
himself takes over: the play follows Bonaparte in the construction of a new
empire of his -a fictional ‘island of all saints’. Teatro
Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of playwrights, actors, dancers,
musicians, stage designers and students committed to the exploration and
creation of new languages for Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia
in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students at the Instituto
Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC has had a long and fruitful trajectory;
their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized the way that theater
is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key contribution to the
field is their method of ‘creación colectiva’ (‘collective
creation’), in which all the participants of the play –including the
audience- become involved with the dramatic text and its staging. In spite
of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique Buenaventura its main
poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC’s texts and directed the
majority of their plays. While TEC’s works address various historical and
social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed for the sake of political
radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that is politically and
culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing its popular
appeal.

520 bb $a This play posits a question: what if Death ruled the world? In order to
probe an answer, ‘Proyecto Piloto’ explores a dark underbelly of
disgusting creatures and diverse representations of death, mainly skeletons
and ghosts. Instead of a majestic Death governing human destinies, we have
four unimportant deaths, who defend their petty interests amid the chaos
surrounding them. These different ‘Deaths’ fight to build their new
order and advance their clearly absurd projects in an equally absurd
manner. They are all fighting in a dark and damp hole, trying to profit
from chaos and confusion. The grotesque, tragicomic nonsense of the play
evokes the nightmare and violence of Colombian politics at the end of the
’80s, the years of Guerra Sucia. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a
collective of playwrights, actors, dancers, musicians, stage designers and

520 bb $a The play tells the story of a ‘barrio de invasión’ (a neighborhood of
internal refugees that ‘invaded’ an empty lot) in the suburbs of Cali.
These neighborhoods are built from scratch by displaced people escaping
from violence and poverty in other regions of Colombia. After building
their homes, the refugees have to fight against the attempts at violent
relocation by the state and the police. The neighborhood in the play is
located by a stream between two hills. The stream is often blood-colored as
a result of fights between the inhabitants of the opposing hills, a rivalry
that evokes the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets in ‘Romeo and
Juliet’. The characters are mainly young gangsters and their girlfriends.
Through break-dancing and rapping, love finds its way among everyday
violence in this symbolic portrait of Colombian society. Teatro

exploration and creation of new languages for Latin American theater.
Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a group of students

520 bb $a Play based on the short story ‘El guardagujas’, by Mexican writer Juan
José Arreola. The action is set in a train station where trains either
never show up or pass by without stopping, leaving different characters
-and their families- stranded.  When the train does pass, some of the
passengers disappear. This sparks endless discussions on the calamitous
situation of train companies in the country (which reflects, and stands
for, the calamitous situation of the country itself). Chaos, uncertainty
and fear grow larger, just as in Colombian society in the 80s (it was the
time of the ‘Guerra Sucia’, the ‘dirty’ civil war that involved the
state, guerrillas and paramilitary forces). Nobody knows which
station they are in. There are no signs. Where are they?  What is their
destination? Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists

American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a

520 bb $a This play has been part of TEC’s repertoire since 1958. It is based on a
short story by Don Tomás Carrasquilla, which elaborates on a widespread
Latin American folk tale. Peralta, the main character, is a peasant, a
mythical figure that represents Colombian identity against all earthly,
heavenly and infernal powers. He is a gambler, but he is a generous
gambler, a Robin Hood-like character who shares everything he earns with
the poorest among his neighbors. Jesus and Saint Peter come down to earth
in order to test Peralta’s honesty. As he passes the test, Jesus grants
him four wishes. He uses them to help the peasants against the landlords,
the King and the Devil. At the end, Peralta becomes as tiny as an ant and
comes to sit on Jesus' right shoulder (‘a la diestra de Dios
Padre’) as his good-hearted advisor. This play is an excellent example of
how ‘creación colectiva’ (collective creation), as a creative method,
works for TEC: the piece was reworked several times, transformed by
audience interaction and the TEC’s ongoing exploration of their
repertoire. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of artists
committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for Latin
American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura and a

on the border that divides folly from crime, a border that is constantly
permeated by bullets and shots. Virgilio, the main character, thinks he has
the right to perform the ‘cleansing’, to execute ‘justice’, to
erect his own court of law.A serial killer, he has developed an obsession
with young and beautiful women (of which he is jealous). He has a
‘shadow’, who follows him and contemplates each of his crimes, torn
between morbid pleasure and a weak desire to stop him. Teatro Experimental

520 bb $a Two old drunk, crazy witches - Verdad (Truth) and Mentira (Lie)- are
condemned to wander around the world. They journey through a universe of
myths and legends as ancient and contemporary as humanity. They visit the
deserted and arid Village of the Hungry, the colorful Diulas Plane, the
dense night of Bereber bandits, and the large desert of the Maasai. The
whole trip works as an educating experience. Eventually, Truth and Lie go
back to the place they left; thanks to their travel experiences, they have
grown up and changed. The play is based on the anthologies of African myths
and tales gathered by Leo Frobenius and Blaise Cendrars: 'The Black
Decameron' and 'Black Anthology'. Black Africans constitute one of the
ethnic groups of Colombia and TEC has always tried to rescue, redeem and
celebrate the diverse roots of Colombian national identity. Teatro

fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work has revolutionized
the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin America. A key
contribution to the field is their method of ‘creación colectiva’
(‘collective creation’), in which all the participants of the play
–including the audience- become involved with the dramatic text and its
staging. In spite of this stress on collective work, TEC had in Enrique
Buenaventura its main poet and playwright, who developed most of TEC’s
texts and directed the majority of their plays. While TEC’s works address
various historical and social issues, artistic quality is not sacrificed
for the sake of political radicalism. TEC has thus created a theater that
is politically and culturally engaged, poetic and innovative without losing
its popular appeal.

520 bb $a Inspired by a chronicle of the Conquest of Mexico by Bernal Díaz del
Castillo, this play tells the story of Gonzalo Guerrero and Jerónimo de
Aguilar, two Spanish sailors who integrate themselves to a Mayan community
after being captured and enslaved by the Mayans. After being freed due to
their good behavior, Guerrero marries the daughter of the Mayan cacique and
starts feeling like a Mayan himself. When Cortés arrives in Mexico, he
tries to talk both sailors into joining his forces. Aguilar accepts this
offer;  Guerrero declines. War, negotiation and betrayal ensue, in a chain
of events that underscores the atrocities surrounding the Conquest of
America. This play highlights native Latin American values and traditions,
as a part of TEC’s continuous attempt to rescue the roots of Latin
American identities. Teatro Experimental de Cali (TEC) is a collective of
artists committed to the exploration and creation of new languages for
Latin American theater. Founded in Colombia in 1955 by Enrique Buenaventura
and a group of students at the Instituto Departamental de Bellas Artes, TEC
has had a long and fruitful trajectory; their artistic and theoretical work
has revolutionized the way that theater is conceived and practiced in Latin

520 bb $a Inspired by Vladimir Nabokov’s novel ‘Invitation to a Beheading’, the
play follows the last moments of a man condemned to death penalty. He is
going to be beheaded but he does not know when. The prisoner is obsessed
with the date of his execution and asks every visitor about this.
Everybody, including the warden, hides this information from him. The
prisoner is alternatively visited by the warden’s daughter, his own
mother, a new inmate, and by the warden; even a group of ghosts or visions
haunts him. Amidst the nightmarish, carnivalesque ebbs and flows of
visitors, the protagonist acts as a deluded philosopher. He alternates
obsessive references to the date of his execution with deep (albeit weird)
philosophical reflections. Faithful to their traditional exploration of
marginal subjects, La Candelaria chooses as main character a true
anti-hero, an underdog trapped in the power games of society. La Candelaria
was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who
came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement.
Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater’s
most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular
audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore,
situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia’s most
compelling plays, some of them through the method of ‘creación
colectiva’ (collective creation), addressing the acute social and
political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the
creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number
of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and
languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire,
experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic
creation.

520 bb $a The tape shows bits of ‘El Quijote’, theater piece by Colombia’s
Teatro La Candelaria; it also presents Santiago García explaining his
perspective on the work and his own staging. Speaking about his creative
process, García tells how he read the book over and over in search of
dramatic parts, trying to find events and adventures in the play that were
not well-known to the public. He found twelve scenes that interested him
and started elaborating on them, working closely and experimentally with
the actors. He also comments on the work of Pedro Alcántara, the person in
charge of the visual aspects of the play, to which Santiago García gives a
lot of importance. After García’s intervention, the tape shows different
scenes of the play. Humorous skits, the excerpts evidence how costumes,
puppets and choreography play a crucial part in La Calendaria’s staging
of ‘El Quijote’. Santiago García then explains what the figure of El
Quijote means to him: he sees great powers of vision in Quijote’s
madness. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent

520 bb $a In this collectively created play, La Candelaria wanted to address the
problem of social and political violence in Colombia through an exploration
of both verbal and non-verbal languages (the latter given special
emphasis). ‘El Paso’ looks like a road bar, a place where people go to
rest or have something to eat while traveling across the country. The truth
is it is a kind of no-place surrounded by violence and social conflicts.
The characters constantly refer to issues from the outside as if
political violence and other danger exist only outside, and the bar was a
haven. However, violence makes its way into the bar: two shady characters irrupt in
the bar’s status quo, forcefully involving the patrons, employees and
passers-by in their shady business. The people at the bar need to negotiate
their complicity or resistance to the illegal activities performed by the
two newcomers, who with their guns and money set an atmosphere of fear and
violence in an otherwise uneventful crossroad’s ‘cantina’. La
Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and
intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian
cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of
Colombian theater’s most innovative agents, modernizing national drama

and affirms he has reached the place where he will stay from then on. But
when he decides to claim this piece of land his own, a new character shows
up and they start arguing. When still more characters appear, Aldo realizes
he was not the first one to arrive at this place. They start judging the
newcomer and going through his belongings. Then they welcome him and he
stays with the inhabitants of the place. Aldo gets involved with one of
them, Alicia; five years go by and they have a child. A priest shows up and
tries to marry them. Alicia becomes a circus artist. With the baby on her
back, Alicia climbs up to the heights of the circus tent. The play ends
with the newcomer begging her to come down. After all these experiences,
Aldo learns that reality is more complex than he had thought, that
sometimes reason, logic and the senses are not completely trustworthy. La

social and political context of this ominous murder, part of the endless
string of violent deaths caused by political violence in Colombia. La
Candelaria goes back to the historical origin of this violence (the fight
between Liberals and Conservatives for national supremacy and its
disastrous effects for the rural poor) in order to offer an interpretation
of its persistence. Guadalupe Salcedo was one of the first victims of
political violence in Colombia. The play ends, as it begins, with his
murder. Likewise, political violence in Colombian seems cyclical and never
ending. The play explicitly connects the 50s to the present. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co)

520 bb $a The play deals with one of Colombia’s most excruciating problems: social
exclusion and its effects on everyday life. The characters in this play are
all urban outcasts: homeless, prostitutes, beggars, etc. They are trying to
build bridges to the larger community through participation in a theater
group. The group wants to do a rendition of García Márquez’s
‘Crónica de una muerte anunciada’. The difficulties and tensions that
arise around this project underline the extreme character of their
exclusion, by-product of the abject poverty and lack of opportunities they
experience in a society dismembered by class fragmentation and
inequalities. At the end, the place where they were rehearsing is shut down
and one of them is killed. The project, too, had a ‘foretold death’.
The play is part of La Calendaria’s exploration of non verbal languages
as means of dramatic expression; it also marks the beginning of the
collaboration with urban poor and the organizations trying to help them. La

520 bb $a Interview with performance artist Jennifer Miller, director of New York’s
troupe Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org), conducted by Mila Aponte-González
for the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics (www.hemisphericinstitute.org). In this
interview, Miller talks about the origins, adventures and exploits of
Circus Amok, commenting on the troupe’s training, the politics and
aesthetics of street performance, their experiences as political and queer
performers in and for New York City communities, some recurrent topics in
their work, and how their aesthetic influences and creative methods juggle
between performance and politics in a collaborative atmosphere. Circus Amok
is a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide
free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the
people of New York City. Directed and founded by Miller, the group has been
together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political
one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the
years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling,
acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning- have been combined with experimental
dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance
art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while
continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets,
gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in
envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a
queer celebratory spectacle.

Conquistador, spellbound by American exuberance, who returns to his country
defeated and sick, just to be punished and forced to keep looking for El
Dorado.We see one of the Spanish conquerors in his last days. He is haunted
by several ghosts (his father, his mother, a woman) who tell him to go to
America to do great deeds and become rich. One by one, all the ghosts from
the past come to pay a visit and judge him. This is one of La
Candelaria’s plays concerned with the violent conquest of America, but it
focus on the conquerors, their miseries and their dreams. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was
founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who
came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement.

520 bb $a Video excerpts of this play. We see the backstage of a theatrical
production. They are planning to do a rehearsal. The play shows the
tensions and conflicts within the creative group as the debut approaches.
They are staging a play about the conquest of America. Some of the actors
seem to be very frustrated with the play and with their career. The play
also shows the connections between theater and political interests and
pressures (the group is the National Company of Theater). The director
hires a group of Indigenous people to perform as Indians from the time of
the Conquest. They refuse to perform without being paid and so the play
becomes a mess. This is the first in a series of disturbances (most of them
associated with political issues) that interrupts and threatens to ruin the
rehearsals and the debut of the piece. This play represents an exercise in
meta-theater by this experienced theater group, a fast-moving mixture of
comedy and a rather serious consideration of the relationship between art
and politics. La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) was founded in 1966 by a group of independent
artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the
broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La
Candelaria is one of Colombian theater’s most innovative agents,
modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of
an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters,
they have created some of Colombia’s most compelling plays, some of them
through the method of ‘creación colectiva’ (collective creation),
addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the
same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro
and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic
creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is
committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental
elements to artistic creation.

520 bb $a In this rendition of the classic Greek tragedy, La Candelaria addresses
once again the horrors of political and social violence in Colombian
society. When Patricia Ariza visited Urabá, a region in Colombia, she
talked to a group of women who could not bury their dead husbands, killed
in the civil war. She connected this awful situation to the myth of
Antigone and read it to the collective. This version of La Candelaria
involves a series of transformations to the original myth. At the
beginning, we see Tiresias walking around an empty space; taking the place
of the chorus, he gives the audience the historical context, recounting
background events that are important for a proper understanding of the
play. The play presents three Antigones and two Ismenes who discuss the
possibility of violating Creonte’s rules in order to bury their brothers
according to tradition. The discussion is thus polyphonic. La Candelaria
was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who
came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement.
Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria (www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater’s
most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular

artists like Miguel Rubio (Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, Peru), Osvaldo
Dragún (Argentina, EITALC), Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed,
Brazil), and Peter Schumman (Bread and Puppet Theater, United States).
Through his experiences in theater, Javier explores experimental dance,
training with Gloria Rampart and Viveca Vázquez in Puerto Rico, as well as
dancing with choreographers Sally Silvers and Jennifer Monson in New York
City. He has worked in community-based theater educational programs, and is
a member of the Taller de Otra Cosa, a collaborative cultural organization
that promotes artistic educational programs in communities and the
development of experimental performing arts events. As a choreographer and
director, Javier explores issues of gender and race, rooted in his
experiences as an Afro Puerto Rican queer artist working in Caribbean,
Latin American and American societies. His one-person dance/theater
performance ‘You Don’t Look Like...’, created in 1996, deals with
themes of race and identity in Puerto Rico, paying special attention to
racial stereotypes pervasive in popular culture and the entertainment
industries. Issues of violence, discrimination and racism experienced by
Afro Caribbeans are dealt with through the exploration of the relationship
between bodies and politics of representation, here performed through
experimental juxtapositions of photographs, dance, anecdotes, and direct
interaction with the audience.

director, Javier explores issues of gender and race, rooted in his
experiences as an Afro Puerto Rican queer artist working in Caribbean,
Latin American and American societies. His dance/theater piece
‘Ah-mén’, created in 2004, is an exploration of masculinity as a
social construct. Through the recreation of visual, verbal and bodily
texts, six dancer/actors perform the intricate networks of prescription,
transmission and enforcement of normative masculinity as maintained by
social institutions such as family, church, school and the state. By
rendering evident the dynamics of power and violence linked to notions and
expectations of masculinity in our collective unconscious, the performers
provoke the audience to re-think our preconceptions of what means to ‘be
a man’.

together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political
one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the
years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling,
acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning- have been combined with experimental

art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while

Through the motif of the beginning of the academic year, and in the context
of the upcoming U.S. presidential elections that same year, the troupe
poses a critique of issues of standardization and accountability, directed
both to the public school system and to Republican U.S. President George W.
Bush’s administration (and its protagonic role in the Iraq War that
started in March 2003). The show poses a public call to civic empowerment
and critical thinking, claiming social justice through a variety of
interwoven skits that honor local and international pedagogues while
performing a satirical commentary on the political climate of the moment,
in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic artistry, satiric skill, and good
old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is a New York City based

520 bb $a Video documentation of Circus Amok’s show, ‘Quality of Life,’
performed in 1998 in diverse New York City parks, squares and other public spaces.
The piece revolves around political, social and economic issues at play in
New York City, while posing a critique of the clash between the needs of
the diverse, multitudinous population of NYC, and the oppressive
governmental policies impacting the city. Poverty, oppressive labor
conditions and other economic inequalities, along with police brutality,
unequal rights for minorities, political oppression, lack of affordable
health services, and excessive construction of corporate and commercial
buildings in residential areas (including the demolition of community
gardens) are some of the topics here exposed. Through the unveiling of
these issues, the piece poses an open call for civic activism and
empowerment, a demand for justice and for a revision of the coordinates of
NYC civil life, all interwoven in a joyful extravaganza of acrobatic
artistry, satiric skill, and good old-fashioned circus fun. Circus Amok (www.circusamok.org) is
a New York City based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide
free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the
people of NYC. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been
together since 1989 bringing its funny, queer, caustic and sexy, political
one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the
years the traditional circus skills - tight rope walking, juggling,
acrobatics, stilt walking, clowning- have been combined with experimental
dance, lifesize puppetry, music old and new, and gender-bending performance
art and improvisational techniques, creating new meanings for circus while
continuing to entertain the crowds of all ages throughout the city streets,
gardens, parks, and playgrounds, inviting the audience to join them in
envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a
queer celebratory spectacle.

most important native leaders in Brazil, with outstanding performance on
behalf of his people, Mekragnotire, and of other Brazilian native people.
Working at FUNAI, he acted in Contact Fronts of the Ikpeng and Panará
People. In 1984 he took part in the setting of the land boundaries of the
Native Land Kapôt - Jarina and, in 1992/1993, of the Native Land
Mekragnotire. He was a FUNAI supervisor of the Parque Indígena do Xingu
(Xingu Indians Park) from 1984 to 1994 and has been the director of FUNAI -

Brazil, 2005 http://hemi.nyu.edu/eng/seminar/brazil2005) titled ‘Performing ‘Heritage’: Contemporary Indigenous
and Community-Based Practices’, Megaron talks about Kaiapó cultural
practices and traditions, their sense of community, as well as their
current situation in contemporary Brazilian geopolitics. The leader
discusses the hardships endured by his people, as well as their efforts to
safeguard their particular cultural heritage and practices in the face of
political pressures to integrate them into a homogeneous, uniform Brazilian
culture. Speaking mainly in his native Kaiapó language, he is introduced
by fellow native leader Ailton Krenak, creator and director of the Centro
de Pesquisa Indígena and Núcleo de Direitos Indígenas (Native Research

520 bb $a Keynote address delivered by Mary Schmidt Campbell at the Hemispheric
Institute’s 5th Encuentro in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 2005 (http://hemi.nyu.edu/eng/seminar/brazil2005). Titled
‘The Role of the Arts in a Time of Crisis’, the keynote addressed the
theme of the role of artists and intellectuals in times of cultural,
political and economic crisis. Ms. Campbell focused her lecture on the
current cultural climate in the United States, from the ‘culture wars’
of the 1980’s to issues of surveillance and fear surrounding the Patriot
Act, paying special attention to considerations of civil liberties and the
public expression of dissent. By means of examples of how works by 20th
century artists engage with their political and social contexts, Campbell
emphasized the critical role of artists, intellectuals and educators in
terms of social conscience, moral critique, and collective action. Scholar,
author and former New York City Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Ms. Campbell
was, at the time of her keynote address, Dean of the Tisch School of the
Arts at New York University. Dr. Campbell began her career in New York as
the executive director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, widely regarded as
the principal center for the study of African and African-American Art.
Dean Campbell, who authored several catalogues on African-American artists,
and frequently curated major exhibitions, firmly established the Museum as
a major New York City cultural institution. In 1999, Crain's New York
selected her as one of the City's 100 Most Influential Women in business,
and in 2001 she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences. Dean Campbell co-authored the books ‘Harlem Renaissance: Art of
Black America’ and ‘Memory and Metaphor: The Art of Romare Bearden,
1940-1987.’ A noted expert on the artist Romare Bearden, Dr. Campbell
also lectures and publishes widely on a range of subjects including arts
policy issues and American cultural history.

508 bb $a Mila Aponte-González, videographer.
511 1b $a Teresa Hernández, interviewee ; Mila Aponte-González, interviewer.
520 bb $a Teresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has
written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in
Puerto Rico’s commercial and experimental art scenes. Along with
choreographer Viveca Vázquez, she directs and administers the Taller de
Otra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the development and
production of experimental dance and performance projects. As a solo
artist, she produces her work since 1991 through her organization
‘Producciones Teresa, no Inc.’. She also offers workshops, talks and
performance demonstrations for high school and college students. Teresa’s
creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of
traditional artistic categories. Theater, dance, performance, dramatic
text, movement, costumes, video and everyday objects are juxtaposed and
confronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are
explored and celebrated. Teresa’s characters explore and expose the
anxieties of everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversally
investigating issues of gender, class and race. In this interview, the
artist talks about her coined term ‘stage artist’ (vis-à-vis
‘perfomer’, ‘actress’ or ‘dancer’) in the light of her
multifaceted training and artistic trajectory. Teresa explains the role of
the ‘taller’ (workshop) as a format and context for artistic creation. She talks
about approximation, appropriation and precariousness as organizing
coordinates of her artistic work. Hernández also discusses the creation
and transformation of her characters, the use of costumes and everyday
objects as stimuli for creation, the exploits of being an experimental
artist in Puerto Rico, and her -at the time of the interview- upcoming
project ‘Nada Que Ver (Composiciones Escénicas Sobre el Yo)’.

Written
by Raul Bopp, it’s one of the most important poems of the Modernismo
Brasileiro.  The Giramundo piece features puppets created in the style of
traditional Carajá craftsmanship and inspired by popular art from Northern
and Northeastern Brazil. Created in 1970 by Brazilian artists Álvaro
Apocalypse, Terezinha Veloso and Maria do Carmo Vivacqua Martins (Madu),
Giramundo Teatro de Bonecos (www.giramundo.org) has gained worldwide
recognition as one of the most important puppet theater groups in the
world. Their remarkable trajectory includes professional works for theater,
film, video, and television, as well as a strong pedagogical component,
teaching workshops and puppetry courses both abroad and in their own school
in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Every year, besides setting up a new show, the
group works on a remake. The 950 marionettes that have already staged or
that are still on stage are part of the Museu Giramundo collection, which
has the largest private collection of the kind in Brazil. At the Museum we
can also find the Coleção de Desenhos e Estudos para Teatro, with
sketches and outlines for set design, and the models of the group´s
creators. The methodological rigor in creating their performances, the
refined construction and manipulation of their performing objects, and
their interest in exploring topics in Brazilian culture have provided
Giramundo with tools for transcending traditional children’s theater in
order to incorporate adult themes and cultural forms in direct dialogue
with complex political and aesthetic issues.

by Rosa Luisa Márquez and Antonio Martorell in the context of their 10-day
residency at MIT in 1992. Involving MIT students, high school students and
members of the Latino communities in Boston and Cambridge, and featuring
metaphorical references to ‘grains’, with sets made of corn tortilla,
bread, pasta, rice, and other disposable materials, the performance
addresses issues of food and shelter that are of social and political
concern to the community. The resulting multicultural, multilingual
performance involves the audience in a ‘cultural pot luck’, a communal
‘voyage of discovery.’ Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater

actress and activist Myrna Vázquez, premiered at the Jorge Hernández
Cultural Center in Villa Victoria, Boston, in July 1995, and later restaged
at the U. of Amherst as a part of the New World Theatre in June 1996. The
work, written and directed by former MIT artist-in-residence Rose Luisa
Márquez, was researched and conceived in conjunction with the MIT Office
of the Arts, IBA Arte y Cultura, Next Stage, Inc., and the Cambridge
Multicultural Arts Center. This production was developed as a collaboration
between Márquez, long-time collaborator Antonio Martorell, Assistant
Professor of Theater Arts Brenda Cotto-Escalera, and professional
performers Noelia Ortiz, Susan Thomson, Melinda López and Cati Lagniel. A
bilingual, agile production, the piece pays homage to the outstanding
theater, film, radio and television performances by Vázquez (born in
Puerto Rico and ‘dying too soon’ in Boston), as well as her commitment
to social and political activism. The reenactment of some of her most
memorable roles –with canonic Puerto Rican texts ‘La Carreta’ and
‘La Pasión Según Antígona Pérez’– by means of objects, songs,
coexisting languages and imaginative spatial articulations, reaches
metatheatrical complexity while entrancing the audience with memories of ‘a heart that loved too much’. Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theatre artist and pedagogue.

520 bb $a Adaptation of ‘Jardín de Pulpos’, renowned play by Argentinean writer
Arístides Vargas (of the Ecuadorian theater group Malayerba), directed by
Rosa Luisa Márquez and collectively created with her students of the
‘Teatro Rodante’ (Traveling Theater) of the University of Puerto Rico,
Río Piedras Campus. A theater piece on memory, atrocity, affect and
resistance, ‘Pulpos’ bridges time (from a mythical time to the ‘Baby
Boomers’ to the ‘Generation X’), and place (with an Andean text
rendered Caribbean, adapted to the Puerto Rican reality) in order to
denounce political repression, police brutality, ideological persecution
and political assassination, and to evoke and pay homage to our dead and
disappeared. An organizing image is that of the ‘velorio’ or wake for a
lost child, (alluding to the canonical Puerto Rican painting by Francisco
Oller and to a contemporary rendition by Rafael Trelles), in an exploration
of memories of loss and a sense of community, of a broader Puerto Rican
family. The recurring motif of the sea shore opens productive
layers of signification, rhythm and spatial organization: it hints to the
waters where Argentineans were ‘disappeared’ during the dictatorship,
the island of Puerto Rico's (geographic and political) borders, and to the Beatles' song ‘Octopus’ Garden’, which inspires the
piece’s title. The resulting performance is an open call to rescue and
safeguard collective memories of political and historical events that have
shaped our present Latin American societies. It is also an artistic attempt
to capture and evoke the sensorial complexities of past events, claiming
them as genealogical landmarks in our current collective life. Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue.

collaborators, Vázquez and Hernández are also co-founders and directors
of Taller de Otra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the
development and production of experimental dance and performance projects.
Here shown is Teresa’s spectacle ‘El ser complejo o el complejo del
ser’, where characters Lic. Perdóname, her sister Perpetua, and art
critic and cultural pundit Isabella Fernández (all performed by
chameleonic Hernández) satirically explore, diatribe and digress on the
complex issues of identity politics and collective memory in contemporary
Puerto Rico. Vázquez, in turn, presents her experimental dance piece
‘Miss Puerto Rico o la isla que se repite’, and reads her paper
‘Baile atroz y coreografía del error’, in which she discusses her
choreographic coordinates in the context of contemporary experimental dance
and performance, particularly in the terms of the current cultural climate
in Puerto Rico. Her lecture is illustrated by means of a slideshow, which
adds to the multimedia aspect of their performance, along with the
projection of the short film/performance piece ‘Viernes social’
(created by Taller de Otra Cosa). Finally, the artists open up the space
for a Q&A session with the audience, in which they talk about their ongoing
creative relationship and the exploits of independent experimental artists
in this day and age.

520 bb $a Teresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Teresa’s creative
projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional
artistic categories. Teresa’s characters explore and expose the anxieties
of everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversally investigating
issues of gender, class and race. ‘Acceso controlado’ is a multimedia
spectacle revolving around the theme of controlled access and the metaphor
(and growing reality) of gated communities in Puerto Rico. Five sections
comprise this piece, with five characters masterfully performed by
Hernández. ‘La Reina’ delivers a fascist, classist, racist speech,
claiming that democratization and mestizaje are crimes against the historic
order. The security guard Teniente Cortés talks about the paranoia and
false ‘security nets’ people resort to –‘controlling’ access
through the now ubiquitous gated communities being one of them- in order to
protect themselves form the alarming growth of criminality in Puerto Rico.
We later find El Chamaco in ‘Primera Plana’, a scene exploring the body
language and expressions of the criminal(ized) youth, bringing to the
forefront the interplay between will and subjection, the criminal life on
the street and the institutional forces trying to control it. A short film
follows, titled ‘Milagros Vélez’, based on ‘Request Concert’ by
Franz Xaver Kroetz and ‘Act without Words’ by Samuel Beckett. The last
piece, ‘La Primera Dama en Solo Operático en Tiempos Desafortunados’
completes the performance, with a hysterical First Lady symbolizing the
banality of complaint in a society where a financial elite controls
cultural expression and politicians hide corruption behind hypocritical
civic concern.

520 bb $a Teresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has
written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in
Puerto Rico’s commercial and experimental art scenes. Teresa’s creative
projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional
artistic categories. Theater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement,
costumes, video and everyday objects are juxtaposed and confronted, placed
in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are explored and
celebrated. ‘La nostalgia del quinqué… una huida’ explores and
exposes the anxieties of everyday life in Puerto Rican society,
transversally investigating issues of gender, class and race. A series of
tableaux vivants of the ‘Puerto Rican Family’ shows a stereotypical
version of the folkloric peasant family (‘jíbaros’) from the
‘literatura costumbrista’ (dealing with the transit form a rural
society to an industrial, urban one) in a tragicomic clash of anachronisms,
self-inflicted bigotry and partisan politics, negotiated in a desperate juggle of contrasting realities, evasion, euphemisms and denial that
evidence the identity crisis of Puerto Rican society. These tableaux
perform an antiphonal relationship to three ‘sister’ characters through
which Hernández exposes her take on Puerto Rican identity crisis and colonialism: Lic.
Perdóname (a district representative), Pragma la continental (with her
self-help lecture inviting Puerto Ricans ‘to climb and to progress’)
and Perpetua (a sensual ‘Pan-Latin’ singer), who, with the help of their
assistant Lamento, unveil the political, socio-historic and ethno-cultural
complexities of ‘the Puerto Rican condition’.

520 bb $a Teresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she has
written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in
Puerto Rico’s commercial and experimental art scenes. Along with
choreographer Viveca Vázquez, she directs and administers the Taller de
Otra Cosa, Inc., a nonprofit organization committed to the development and
production of experimental dance and performance projects. As a solo
artist, she produces her work since 1991 through her organization
‘Producciones Teresa, no Inc.’. She also offers workshops, talks and
performance demonstrations for high school and college students. Teresa’s
creative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of
traditional artistic categories. An excellent example and exploration of
her experimental, alternative work is ‘Infarto’ (Heart Attack), where
theater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement, costumes, video,
animation, projections, music and everyday objects are juxtaposed and
confronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are
explored and celebrated. Along with fellow experimental performers Eduardo
Alegría and Yamil Collazo, Teresa exposes the struggles, anxieties and
exploits of being experimental artists in Puerto Rico. Forced migration,
bigotry, lack of available spaces and proper funding, and the pressure to
define their work within fixed boundaries of traditional art forms all pose
a daily threat to artists, who metaphorically ‘infartan’ due to these
social, political and economic conditions. In turn, the artists celebrate
precariousness, the unpolished work of art, the slippery path between
disciplines, embracing affect and humor to assert publicly that their work
is ‘a different kind of performance’: ‘lo mío es otro
teatro.’

520 bb $a Short film by Puerto Rican stage artist Teresa Hernández and her
Producciones Teresa, no inc., in collaboration with director of photography
Daniel Cotté and editor Vicente Juarbe. Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island
struggling with an authentic identity crisis, torn in the in-between zone
of an oblique colonialism, delusions of cosmopolitan aspirations sold by
tourism advertisements, a half baked bilingualism, and self-inflicted
bigotry, produces a ‘foreign movie’ which is at the same time a
‘Puerto Rican film’. Spoken in a fictional pidgin, and subtitled in
Spanish, it portrays a tragicomic Grand Reunion of individuals fixed on
evading and denying the ‘Puerto Rican condition’ through the
impersonation of alternative citizenships and absurd allegiances. The video
art piece show subjects living in anachronism and escapism, surrounding
themselves in an artificial aura of the exotic that directly contrasts with
the everyday life in the island’s metropolitan area. The short film,
shown as a stand-alone piece in film festivals locally and abroad, is also
a building block of sorts, combined and recombined by Hernández in her
multimedia spectacles in order to explore and unveil the complex layers of
negotiation and denial at play in issues of identity politics of our
postmodern societies.

‘Teatreros Ambulantes’ (Itinerant Performers, 1987-1990), resulting in
twelve productions. ‘Otra Maldad de Pateco,' here showcased, is one of
these projects. Based on a text by renowned Puerto Rican writer Ana Lydia
Vega, this recording for television portrays the story of a child of a
slave owner family; born with a white body and black head, Pateco needs to
decide where his allegiance lies. As explained by Márquez in the video, Afro Caribbean characters and Puerto
Rican traditional games and crafts are incorporated to the performance
as a social and pedagogical intervention in the public sphere aiming to open up a discussion on
race while rendering drama activities and traditional stories accessible
to the Puerto Rican population.

time when AIDS and condoms were still taboo in Puerto Rico), this is a
re-staging made in 1991 for health educators. The performance is inspired
in Augusto Boal’s ‘image theater,’ proposing images based on common
prejudices and attitudes related to sexuality and AIDS, as a provocation to
reflect and discuss new interpretations and alternatives to these social
and health issues. The audience is invited to join the performers in
creating and transforming images, exploring alternatives for the
transformation of current social attitudes towards AIDS.

characters, the performers invite the audience to join them onstage to act

possible solutions to the conflict and to transform the situation from
within.

portrayal of women as objects of desire are juxtaposed in order to elicit a
critical revision of the social codes concerning gender at play in Puerto
Rican society.

Performed at the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey Campus’ cafeteria on
the International Women’s Day (March 8th, 1987), the piece is a
collective creation on the media depictions of women as objects of desire
and consumption. By parodically exposing advertisement’s slogans and
social preconceptions of beauty, womanhood and desire, the performance is
an open call to critical thinking and discussion on the social codes
concerning gender, objectification and consumption at play in Puerto Rican
society.

Villanueva, a woman who was assassinated by the police in the Afro-Puerto Rican town of
Loíza while defending her home and family during a forced eviction
operative on February 6th, 1980. The piece brings to the forefront issues
of human rights and current tensions between impoverished communities and
developers of ‘exclusive’ building projects, all issues affecting the
Puerto Rican society as a whole: as the piece states, ‘we are all on the
same boat.’

artist Oscar Mestey as a final project with her students of the course
'Drama Activities' at the University of Puerto Rico. Based on
the eponymous story by writer Kalman Barsy, the piece tells a mythical
account of the birth of the island of Puerto Rico. Indigenous Taíno
iconography, performing objects made of everyday artifacts, experimental
storytelling, live music and infectious Caribbean rhythms create a
submarine world where sea creatures join together to reshape the Earth,
fulfilling an island’s secret dream. This piece consolidated the group
of students who later became the Teatreros Ambulantes.

participants, this public demonstration condemned the political
intervention of the United States in Nicaragua. Willie Colón’s ‘La era

diverse masks, puppets, banners and other artistic strategies developed by
‘Taller de la Escarcha’ in order to claim a cease and desist of
American political interventions in Central America.

520 bb $a An adaptation of ‘Réquiem por Yarini’, a play written in the '60s by
Cuban playwright Carlos Felipe, ‘La Vida en Rosa’ is the story of
Alejandro Yarini, a pimp and politician stabbed to death in the early
1900s. A ‘musical tragedy’, the piece revolves around a love triangle
in an environment ruled by foreign capital, prostitution and tourism, a
tropical masquerade in cabaret style where song and dance are masks for sadness,
innocence, tragedy. The play is an exploration of passion, questioning
heritage and myth, a critical look at the past and the manifold structures
of time. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher
Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba’s most
celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two
parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a
permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean
cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the
renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between
music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms
of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, have consolidated Teatro
Buendía’s international prestige as a company that has presented their
repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America,
Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim.
They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences
on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

520 bb $a Adaptation written by Raquel Carrió and Flora Lauten, based on texts by
Shakespeare, Carpentier, Paz, Martí, and Caribbean folktales, rituals and
songs from Yoruban and Araran cultures. An exploration of the conflicting
and syncretic coordinates of ‘cubanidad’, ‘Otra Tempestad’ tells
the story of the labyrinthical encounters (dreamt or imagined) between
well-known Shakespearean characters and key figures of Afro-Caribbean
mythology. Fifteen ‘cuadros’, constantly cycling from death to utopia
to death, examine archetypal behavior, investigating the space where worlds
collide, the confluence of old and new world orders. The performance here
documented was staged in the context of ‘The Season of Justice and
Mercy’ (1998) at the reconstructed Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in
London. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher
Institute of Arts, Havana, and directed by Flora Lauten, is Cuba’s most
celebrated theater company. Since its foundation, they have developed two
parallel lines of work: the production of theater spectacles, and a
permanent research center investigating Latin American and Caribbean
cultural traditions, the expressive possibilities of the actor, and the
renewal of scenic languages. The study of the possible relations between
music, dance, and interpretation, as well as the formulation of new forms
of scenic writing and dramaturgy of the spectacle, have consolidated Teatro
Buendía’s international prestige as a company that has presented their
repertoire in the most demanding festivals and venues of Latin America,
Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, all to critical acclaim.
They also tour internationally giving workshops, seminars and conferences
on their cultural investigations and creative methods.

520 bb $a Carlos Celdrán and Flora Lauten’s version of ‘La increíble y triste
historia de la cándida Eréndira y su abuela desalmada’, the famous
story by renowned Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, is a
theatrical exploration of intimacy, nostalgia and divestment. The creative
process was deeply invested in the investigation of the expressive
possibilities of the dramaturgy of the actor, the characters and the
essential myth within the story, in order to unveil the hidden metaphor of
Eréndira. Teatro Buendía, formed in 1986 by graduates from the Higher

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, ‘Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice’, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This
video documents their piece ‘Miss Risqué’, a story of secrets and
showgirls, set in turn-of-the-century Paris, where working-class girls
could become rich and famous, prostitutes could pass for nobility, women could have open affairs with women, and sex wasn’t exclusive to the marital bed. A piece on ‘resistant femininity’, ‘Miss Risqué’ is a
lyrical lesbian tarantella that explores the power of femininity,
visibility, invisibility and deception. It was commissioned by the Nuffield Theatre, Lancaster University and supported by the National Lottery through the Arts Council of England, the London Arts Board, and Queen Mary, University of London. This video documents its NY premiere at La Mama, in the context of the show ‘Double Agency’, the first collaboration between Split Britches and the renowned English troupe The Clod Ensemble. A two-piece spectacle, 'Double Agency’ also features the piece ‘It's A Small House and We've Lived in It Always.’

This video documents their piece ‘It’s a Small House and We've Lived in it Always’. In it, two explorers lay claim to the same territory. With three chairs as its only props, little speech, some song and much meaningful movement and expressive acting, the piece shows longtime cohabitants engaged in a contest for space. These people have known each other for a long time. They occupy a house the size of a small stage, a house divided and subdivided by time and bad habits.  They sit on the porch, watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change.  Their only hope is an audience. As they move apart and then together, spurn advances and accept closeness, mime rejection and flirtation and reveal need, the two performers enact the ebb and flow of a universally resonant relationship. This work was first commissioned by the South Bank Center as part of the
British Festival of Visual Theatre. This video documents its NY premiere at La Mama, in the context of the show ‘Double Agency’, the first collaboration between Split Britches and the renowned English troupe The Clod Ensemble.

faith meets science and sermons meets striptease and she reconciles how a

by Peggy Shaw, Lois Weaver and James Neale Kennerely and performed by Peggy
Shaw and Lois Weaver. 'Lust and Comfort’ uses three story lines to
examine the ups and downs of a long term relationship and the changing
terrain of sexual desire.  Using cross-dressing characters and movie
references to ‘The Servant’ and ‘The Bitter Tears of Petra Von
Kant,’ Shaw and Weaver address how lesbians invent their lives out of
popular heterosexual cultural references.

It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics.

Their collection of scripts, ‘Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice’, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. ‘Salad of the Bad
Café’ is a postmodern cabaret written and performed by Lois Weaver and
Peggy Shaw of Split Britches and Asian American performance artist Stacy Makishi. Inspired by Carson McCullers' story ‘The Ballad of the Sad Café’ and the lives of Tennessee Williams and Yukio Mishima, it is a treatise on love in a post-claustrophobic era. The play begins in 1945, in the summer that lay between the war and the postwar period when Japan was weeping, the American South was seething and the word 'gender' was mostly used in grammar class. The setting is a café where people come to spend a few hours so that
the ‘deep bitter knowing that their life is not worth much can be laid to
rest.’ Racial, gender and regional stereotypes come together to tell a
story of unrequited love, in an attempt to demystify the Queer, disorient
the Orient and demythify the Southern Gothic and the American Grotesque.
This is one of the first iterations of the piece, performed as a
work-in-progress in London in 1998.

Peggy Shaw’s one-woman show ‘You’re Just Like My Father.’ In this
performance Shaw pieces together the challenges of growing up butch in the
1950’s with a combination of both toughness and vulnerability.  Using
male role models such as an Army officer and Elvis, Shaw explores the
controversial relationship between a butch and her mother, offering both
affirmation and criticism. If on the surface ‘You're Just Like My
Father’ seems to be a wry exercise in pseudo-macho braggadoccio, it has
its poignant undercurrents. Shaw’s performance isn't so much a satire of
male chauvinism as a pure celebration of her masculine self.

going through ‘the change.’  An Obie-winning, tour de force one-woman
show about a menopausal body and the fires of its ageless heart, Peggy
Shaw's ‘Menopausal Gentleman’ is a revelation. Shaw riffs on the
hormonal effects of menopause complete with hot flashes, cold sweats, humor
and tears, penetrating and perpetuating the mystery in an unlikely persona.
She is a tough-speaking film-noir soul performed in Shaw's trademark drag
patois (a self-conscious and artificially low New Yorkese), or to put it
simply: a tough guy in a swell suit!

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, ‘Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice’, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This
video documents their show ‘Lesbians Who Kill,’ written by Deb Margolin
in collaboration with Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver. Performed by Shaw and
Weaver as characters May and June, a couple who go very ‘wrong,’ the play looks at
what might motivate women and lesbians in particular to become killers and
serial ones at that.

politics and informed by the Christian agenda that dominates the US scene
up till the present, it is the personal journey of a Salvation Army woman
who plays the good and beautiful daughter who secretly wants to be bad, a
Rabbi in pink toe shoes who is relegated to the role of the father and
longs to be a stand-up comic, and an 86-year-old lesbian vaudeville freak
who embraces the role of the Beast and comments on politics by forgetting

appropriation of the ‘husband and wife team’ identities represented in
vaudeville variety acts, comedy duos and musical duets.

They describe their work in this way: 'Our work is rooted in popular culture, but positioned against it. It relies on moments rather than plot, relationships rather than story. It depends on the surprise of transformation rather than the logic of psychological narrative. It straddles the line between performance and theater, exploiting theatricality while exposing the pretense. It is about a community of outsiders, queers, eccentrics. It is feminist because it encourages the imaginative potential in everyone and lesbian because it takes the presence of lesbian on stage as a given.' Their vaudevillian satirical gender-bending performances have received numerous awards, including a Jane Chamber award and four Village Voice OBIE awards. Their collection of scripts, ‘Split Britches Feminist Performance/Lesbian Practice’, edited by Sue Ellen Case, won the 1997 Lambda Literary Award for Drama. This
video documents the first version of their show ‘Little Women: The
Tragedy.’ Here performed as a work-in-progress, the piece tackles complex
issues of pornography and feminism through the humor of only two
possibilities: heaven or hell, preacher or prostitute, and the left hand
and right hand of Louisa May Alcott.

520 bb $a Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino (www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their ‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and
cultural perceptions. ‘Bandido!’ deals with the life and times, and
subsequent death of Tiburcio Vasquez, the last of the Mexican California
resistance fighters. Written in 1979/1980, 'Bandido!' was first staged by
ETC in 1982, as part of a celebration of 19th Century history in San Juan
Bautista, where Vasquez himself lived from 1863-1865.  The events of the
play cover the last desperate robbery by Vasquez and his followers in Tres
Pinos, California and their pursuit by lawmen and their posses across the state all
the way to Los Angeles, where the notorious bandit was wounded and
captured. His notoriety inspired an impresario to stage the capture of
Vasquez in an instant melodrama, which was a big hit in an LA theater,
while the bandit was behind bars in the city jail. As a bilingual poet and
'ladies man', Vasquez had all the makings of a matinée idol and despite
the unsavory nature of his crimes he was visited by women until the end.
Playwright Luis Valdez thought the layering of melodrama upon melodrama was
suitable material for a play that questions the 'manifest destiny of the
Old West' while mocking the melodramatic excesses of the period.

the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and
cultural perceptions. Valdez believes in a total theater—one where an
elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and
drama to stimulate a ‘New American Audience,’ a celebration of cultural
diversity. This is a documentary of ETC’s ‘The Passion Play’. Opening
with a narration by Luis Valdez about the piece and a brief history of ETC,
the documentary shows a fragment of the performance, which focuses on the
Via Crucis (the Way of the Cross) as the condemned Messiah makes his way to
his Crucifixion. The text is adapted from the New Testament, with a
narrator serving to connect the traditional Stations of the Cross. Staged
in the historic town plaza, fronting the old Mission of San Juan Bautista
(founded in 1797), this open air spectacle allowed the audience to follow
the various scenes both as observers and participants, as the action moved
from place to place around the public square. Alternate performances were
offered in English and in Spanish.

520 bb $a Arguably El Teatro Campesino’s most famous play, ‘Zoot Suit’ was
originally produced in 1978 at the Mark Taper Form where it ran for an
unprecedented twelve weeks and has since then been revived numerous times,
including this production in 2003. In 1981, it was adapted into a feature
film for Universal Films. ‘Zoot Suit’ is based on the 1942 ‘Sleepy
Lagoon’ murder mystery and the Zoot Suit Riots that occurred in Los
Angeles after that.  The riots took place in the racially charged
environment of Los Angeles where sailors, soldiers and marines returning
from World War II came into conflict with local Mexican zoot suiters. On
June 3, 1943 a group of servicemen alleged they had been assaulted by a
group of Pachucos, Mexican American youth who had their own subculture
during the 1930s and 40s in the American Southwest. They wore distinctive
clothing, such as zoot suits, and spoke a dialect, Calo, which is
represented in this ETC production; they were often associated with gang
activity. A larger group of servicemen gathered in the center of the
Mexican community in Los Angeles where they attacked men wearing zoot
suits. The police responded by arresting Mexican American youths, who had
been attacked in the riots, for disturbing the peace. ETC's ‘Zoot Suit’
combines fact and fiction to show the fate of twenty-two Mexican Americans brought
to trial for a murder they did not commit. The character of Henry Reyna is
based upon real-life zoot suiter Henry Leyvas, who was tried and wrongfully
convicted of first-degree murder of Jose Diaz in 1942 (the Sleepy Lagoon
murder). Reyna and his friends were set free in 1945 after the Zoot Suit
Riots and the banning of zoot suits in Los Angeles in 1944. The goal of
this production was to lock into a definitive stage version, while allowing
a new generation of artists to take it where they will. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves 
and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and 
to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore 
and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions.

holidays, alternating with ‘La Virgen del Tepeyac’, in the historic

of angels overpower the demonic powers of Luzbel and the shepherds are at

520 bb $a It is the summer of 1973, and the United Farm Workers are fighting for
their lives. Led by Cesar Chavez, a march comes to Burlap, California, a
fictional tank town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. This is the
background for playwright, director and El Teatro Campesino’s founder
Luis Valdez’ vintage classic, ‘Mundo Mata,’ a period piece that
exposes the raw realities of life in a small farmworker town. As part of an
epic struggle to achieve victory in union elections among ranches up and
down the state, the campaign in Burlap brings together two brothers and
pulls them apart. One is Bullet Mata, who returns to his old hometown for
the first time in twelve years; the other, his older brother Mundo is a
Vietnam veteran. Bullet is a college dropout, turned Chavista sworn to
non-violence. Mundo is a drug dealer, secretly hired by two growers to stop
Chavez. While the issue of violence versus non-violence becomes a personal
matter between the two brothers, ‘Mundo Mata’ also resonates within a
larger landscape of the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. What if
Cesar Chavez had been assassinated in 1973? Would history remember him
differently? These are some of the questions implied in this gritty drama
about the farmworkers’ struggle for justice. ‘Mundo Mata’ premiered
in 1976 in El Paso, Texas in the Chamizal Theater on the borderline with
Juarez, Mexico. After being retired, the play was revived, rewritten and
restaged, as documented in this 2001 production. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino

520 bb $a This video documents El Teatro Campesino’s performance ‘Mummified
Deer’. The play was inspired by a 1984 newspaper article describing an
86-year-old woman in Juarez, Mexico who was found to be carrying a
60-year-old mummified fetus in her womb. Fifteen years later, playwright,
director and founder of ETC Luis Valdez returned to the article while
simultaneously embarking on a highly personal investigation of his own
family history. Valdez traveled to Sonora, Mexico to investigate his
family’s Yaqui roots and ancestral history; ‘Mummified Deer’ derived
from his time in Mexico and the newspaper article, in what Valdez considers
to be his most personal play to date. Armida, Valdez’s mother, is
re-envisioned as a young woman by the same name; his grandmothers, aunts
and cousins fused into the other leading characters. The main action of the
play takes place in 1999 by the side of Mama Chu’s hospital bed, but also
flashes back to 1969 when the Chicano Movement was just starting, back
through the thirties and twenties, to the turn of the 20th Century and the
Mexican Revolution when Mama Chu crosses the border into the United States.
The genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico, forcing Mama Chu to migrate
to the US, is only one of the family’s buried secrets. In spite of the
fluidity of time zones, what anchors all the action is the constant
presence of a young Yaqui deer dancer who dances but does not speak,
symbolizing the 60-year-old mummified fetus. The play incorporates themes
of family conflict within the broader context of history and social
struggle. Staged two years after the original production at the San Diego
Repertory Theater, this version of ‘Mummified Deer’ contains several
changes and refinements to the script. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves 
and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and 
to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore 
and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions.

520 bb $a This video documents El Teatro Campesino’s performance 
‘Mummified
Deer’. The play was inspired by a 1984 newspaper article describing 
an
86-year-old woman in Juarez, Mexico who was found to be carrying 
a
60-year-old mummified fetus in her womb. Fifteen years later, 
playwright,
director and founder of ETC Luis Valdez returned to the article 
while
simultaneously embarking on a highly personal investigation of his 
own
family history. Valdez traveled to Sonora, Mexico to investigate 
his
family’s Yaqui roots and ancestral history; ‘Mummified Deer’ 
derived
from his time in Mexico and the newspaper article, in what Valdez 
considers
to be his most personal play to date. Armida, Valdez’s mother, 
is
re-envisioned as a young woman by the same name; his grandmothers, 
aunts
and cousins fused into the other leading characters. The main action of 
the
play takes place in 1999 by the side of Mama Chu’s hospital bed, but 
also
flashes back to 1969 when the Chicano Movement was just starting, 
back
through the thirties and twenties, to the turn of the 20th Century and 
the
Mexican Revolution when Mama Chu crosses the border into the United 
States.
The genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico, forcing Mama Chu to 
migrate
to the US, is only one of the family’s buried secrets. In spite of 
the
fluidity of time zones, what anchors all the action is the constant
presence of a young Yaqui deer dancer who dances but does not 
speak,
symbolizing the 60-year-old mummified fetus. The play incorporates 
themes
of family conflict within the broader context of history and 
social
struggle. Staged two years after the original production at the San 
Diego
Repertory Theater, this version of ‘Mummified Deer’ contains 
several
changes and refinements to the script. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El 
Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves 
and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and 
to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore 
and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions.

juvenile delinquent son, the pregnant/unwed daughter, the indigent older

drama to stimulate a ‘New American Audience,’ a celebration of cultural
diversity. This video documents a rehearsal of El Teatro Campesino’s
rendition of Alfred Jarry’s play ‘Ubu Roi’. Directed by Kinan Valdez,
this piece represents the newer generation of ETC which in the mid-nineties
began to train in classic world theater while simultaneously ‘pushing the
envelope’ of the classic styles they were examining and of ETC’s
production choices.  This production of Ubu was created in 1996 in the
context of the 100-year anniversary of Jarry's Ubu. A satire of William
Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth’, Ubu has no ambition, is idiotic, and is
pushed into a kingdom by his wife. In this production of ‘Ubu Roi’,
instead of banishing Ubu out of the kingdom, he is banished to the New
World.

520 bb $a ‘Corridos: Tales of Passion and Revolution’, nationally broadcast on
PBS and the winner of the George Peabody for excellence in Television in
1987, was the final result of the El Teatro Campesino's stage production of
the same name. The piece began as a five-week workshop in ETC's San Juan
Bautista playhouse in the summer of 1982, exploring the stories and
narrative lyrics of Mexican popular ballads or ‘corridos’. The workshop
production was an instant popular success with audiences and critics. ETC
decided to stage a new production of ‘Corridos’ at the Marines Memorial
Theater in San Francisco, where it ran for three months to great reviews
and eleven Bay Area Critics Awards. Other stagings followed in 1984.
‘Corridos’ finally evolved into a full-fledged video production in
1987, after several drafts of the script that not only reworked the
selection of ballads, but also condensed the material to fit into the
confines of a one-hour special. The production presents two full-length
‘corridos’: ‘Delgadina’ (a haunting parable of incest in a wealthy
Mexican family), and ‘Soldadera’ (based on the dispatches of American
journalist John Reed, in which the compelling story of Elizabeta is framed
by three songs of women during the 1910 Mexican Revolution). Highlights
from other traditional ‘corridos’ are connected by engaging narrative
sequences: ‘Yo soy El Corrido’ (the story of the ‘corrido’ itself),
‘Rosita Alvirez’ (a comedic parable of a defiant young woman who meets
an early death), and ‘El Lavaplatos’ (the story of an immigrant who
dreams of becoming a movie star and ends up a dishwasher). Joining members
of the original cast, the production included popular songstress Linda
Ronstadt, singer/actor Daniel Valdez, San Francisco Ballet artist Evelyn
Cisneros, and actor Clancy Brown. All in all, ‘Corridos’ broke ground with a form of musical popular theater that made the transition from theater to television without losing its theatricality. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino (www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their ‘actos’ in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and their values in the actos.

520 bb $a ‘Los Vendidos’ is a television adaptation of an ‘acto’ first staged
by El Teatro Campesino in 1967. The piece is set in Honest Sancho's Used
Mexican Lot and Curio Shop, where various models of Chicano automatons
(robots) are displayed for sale by Honest Sancho. Into his shop comes Miss
Jimenez who represents the governor's office (at the time, Ronald Reagan's)
and is in search of a ‘Mexican type’ for the administration. Sancho
escorts her around his shop and demonstrates various floor models (farm
worker, Mexican revolutionary, pachuco, lowrider), activating them by
snapping his fingers and giving vocal commands.  None of these are
acceptable to her. She wants a Mexican, yes, but it is more important that
he be an American. She is about to leave when Honest Sancho urges her to
view his newest model: a fresh, clean Mexican-American in a business suit
and glasses, whom she instantly loves and purchases on the spot for $15,000
(a great deal of money in 1972). She drives off with him to the governor's
banquet. Once she is gone, Sancho falls silent, and all the store models
come to life. We learn that Sancho is the real automaton and all the others
are Chicanos and Chicanas running a scam on fools who believe in robots.
The ‘acto’ is bracketed by opening and closing scenes on a pyramid,
where many of the characters from ETC's actos are arranged, frozen in
action. In the very center is the Aztec Calendar, whose painted face is
that of Luis Valdez, founder and director of El Teatro Campesino. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves 
and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and 
to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore 
and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions.

acquaintances. They are all stuck in the afterworld repeating the vices and
sins of their lives. Mundo's friends try to convince him to take over the
world of the dead. 'El Fin del Mundo' was created through a workshop by the ETC 'Youth Actors Ensemble' attended by children and teenagers
ranging from ages 9 to 17. In some ways, then, and in the context of its young
performers, the production can be seen as an ‘anti-drug’ piece. The
training and style related to this piece left an indelible mark on later

Written in 1970 and revived in 2000, the action of the piece takes place in
the small fictional town of Burlap, located in the central San Joaquin
Valley of California. With a population of only a couple of thousand
inhabitants, Burlap is the hometown of Bernabé, a mentally retarded farm
worker who is ‘touched by cosmic madness.’ The performance takes us
from the sun-baked reality of the valley into the mythological darkness of
Bernabe’s mind. The abstract set reflects the world of its protagonist,
blending myth and reality, above and below the surface of the earth.
Burlap, California is also the setting for another Luis Valdez’ play,
‘Mundo Mata,’ a period piece that exposes the raw realities of life in
a small farmworker town.

After studying the theory of French theater practitioner Antonin Artaud and
his conceptualization of a Theater of Cruelty (which emphasized the
importance of gesture and physicality as its own expressive language and
also challenged concepts of reality vs. perception), Kinan Valdez adapted
Percy Bysshe Shelley’s play ‘The Cenci’ (1819), which Artaud staged. 
In this controversial play, inspired by a real Italian family (the Cencis,
in particular, Beatrice Cenci), the Cenci family conspires to assassinate
the father figure in an attempt to stop his reign of terror, torture, rape
and incest. The father unveils the conspiracy, with tragic, fatal
consequences. It is a very dark piece that applies the Teatro Campesino
aesthetic to Shelley’s script, adding a highly physicalized visual score
to a text-heavy piece, which also mirrors Artaud’s physically-based
theatrical style.  According to director Kinan Valdez, the play was not
well-received by the ETC audiences because of its controversial
themes.

520 bb $a This ‘Carpa de los Rasquachis’ was preceded by another ‘carpa’
(tent show) written by Luis Valdez, called ‘La Carpa Cantiflesca’
(1972). Since 1965, Valdez had described El Teatro Campesino as a cross
between Brecht and Cantinflas. ‘La Carpa Cantinflesca’ was his attempt
to pay homage to the great comic and Mexican movie star Mario Moreno,
a.k.a. Cantinflas, who had begun his career performing in Mexican tent
shows. Thus in ‘La Carpa Cantinflesca’ Valdez created a family of
Cantinflas types: Cantinflín, Cantinflón, Cantinflucha; all the characters,
including the women, wore Cantinflas costumes. The piece told the story of
the family in three parts: the parents (Mexicans), the sons (Mexican-Americans),
and the daughter (La Chicana). When the idea proved to be too esoteric,
Valdez eliminated the Cantinflas references but kept the three generational
elements, and renamed the show ‘Carpa de los Rasquachis’. This early
version of ‘La Carpa’ still retains the three-act family structure,
utilizing ‘corridos’ (Mexican ballads) to provide the narrative line.
In time, it became apparent that the three-generation structure and the
epic nature of their collective tale were too much for a single play. So,
after 1974, Valdez conflated all three stories into a single focus on one
main ‘corrido’, the story of the patriarch, Jesus Pelado Raquachi,
peripherally telling the story of the family. In this early version of the
‘Carpa de los Rasquachis’, titled ‘La Familia Rascuache’, it is
clear that Valdez and the Teatro were still wrestling with creative
elements regarding the acting style, musical arrangement, and narrative
continuity of its single Corrido, which ultimately gave shape to the final,
precise 1975 version called ‘La Gran Carpa de Los Rasquachis’. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves 
and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international

Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early

produced in 1974, and underwent several revisions until 1976, when it was
locked into the definitive version seen in this revival performed by a new
generation of ETC actors more than twenty years after its premiere. The
‘carpa’ (itinerant tent show) presents the epic life story of
farmworkers in America. Told through the struggles, frustrations and
ultimate victory of a single Chicano, the Rasquachi saga (‘working-class’,
‘underdog’) comes alive in corridos (Mexica ballads) that tell of
life’s tragedies with an ironic, rollicking earthy good humor. The story
follows Jesus Pelado Rasquachi, leaving his own mother and brother in
Mexico as he heads for the United States, in hopes of ‘getting rich’ as
a bracero. Misfortune and fate, however, stalks his every footstep, in the
guise of El Diablo and La Calavera. Tricked and betrayed at every turn,
Jesus Pelado becomes a pathetic comic figure in the hands of the growers,
contractors, bar owners, and social workers, and ultimately, the
undertaker.

520 bb $a Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino (www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their ‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and
cultural perceptions. Valdez believes in a total theater—one where an
elevation of sensation is achieved through a trinity of music, dance and
drama to stimulate a ‘New American Audience,’ a celebration of cultural
diversity. ‘The Four Roads’ is a documentary celebrating El Teatro
Campesino’s 25th anniversary. A retrospective showcasing the group’s
broad spectrum of theater projects, it contains a rich array of archival
footage and interviews. The documentary is organized by the Mayan myth of
the Four Roads –central to ETC’s philosophy and aesthetic-, here
presented as ‘the four roads of creation’: the Road of the Heart, the
Road of the Body, the Road of the Mind, and the Road of the Soul. It is a
fitting homage to the outstanding artistic contributions of El Teatro
Campesino to Chicano culture and to popular theater around the
world.

520 bb $a Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican 
theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 
1971, she holds a Master’s degree from New York University and a Doctorate 
from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa 
Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University 
of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama 
Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab 
centers, women’s shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing 
projects include ‘Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),’ ‘Historias para ser 
Contadas,’ ‘La Leyenda del Cemí,’ ‘Procesión,’ ‘Waiting for 
Godoy,’ ‘Jardín de Pulpos,’ ‘Absurdos en Soledad,’ ‘El León y la 
Joya,’ among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio 
Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) 
resulting in twelve productions. Published books include ‘Brincos y saltos: 
el juego como disciplina teatral’ and ‘Historias para ser contadas, montaje 
de Rosa Luisa Márquez.’ She is a member of the board of directors and 
pedagogical team for the EITALC´s International School of Latin American and 
Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and 
Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani 
(Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and 
Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). This video
documents the theater piece ‘Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),’ created
collaboratively by Márquez with her students of the course of 
Experimental
Theater at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus. Based 
on
Pablo Neruda’s version of the classic Shakespearean tragedy, the 
play
crystallizes a year-long investigation on the creative links 
between
theater and visual arts, in homage to renowned Puerto Rican scenographer 
José
'Checo' Cuevas. Antonio Martorell collaborated with this elaborated 
version
of 'Romeo and Juliet,' where the classic feud between Montagues and 
Capulets
echoes the current political climate of colonialism, warfare, and ‘an 
eye
for an eye’ political mentality affecting American foreign
affairs, with concrete resonances with the Iraq War as well as with social and 
political violence at play in Puerto Rico.

created through the improvisational input of actresses María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés and
Rosa Luisa Márquez, the directorial and dramaturgical vision of Arístides Vargas,
and the visual and spatial transformations of Antonio Martorell, ‘Buñuelos’
portrays the multiple encounters of two friends in time and space. Between
life and death, memories and games, Catalina and Miranda weave their
relationship, a virtual motherland amidst political and emotional exile.
Music by Puerto Rican artist María Pilar Aponte (who performs an enigmatic
character, an Angel of Death of sorts) complements their journey.

Argentinean playwright Arístides Vargas and directed in Puerto Rico by
Márquez, as a part of her ongoing artistic collaboration with Ecuadorean theater collective Malayerba (of which Vargas is director and founding member). Inspired by the 400th anniversary of the publication of Cervantes' ‘El
Quijote,’ by Kafka’s writings on Quixote and Sancho, and by the strategies
of survival of political prisoners during Argentina’s Dirty War (more
specifically, the actual experiences of Vargas’ brother, Chicho), ‘La
razón’ is a piece about imprisonment, madness, storytelling and
solidarity. In this staging by Márquez, the text is adapted to the Puerto
Rican reality, exploring issues of political imprisonment that links
pervasive Latin American political atrocities to selective profiling, political persecution, and the complex colonial condition of Puerto Rico.

520 bb $a Rosa Luisa Márquez (www.marquezmartorell.org) is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue. Founding member of the theater group Anamú in 1971, she holds a Master’s degree from New York University and a Doctorate from Michigan State University; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the Theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women’s shelters, nursing homes and community centers. Her directing projects include ‘Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),’ ‘Historias para ser Contadas,’ ‘La Leyenda del Cemí,’ ‘Procesión,’ ‘Waiting for Godot,’ ‘Jardín de Pulpos,’ ‘Absurdos en Soledad,’ ‘El León y la Joya,’ among others. In conjunction with Puerto Rican visual artist Antonio Martorell, she created the concept of Itinerant Performers (1987-1990) resulting in twelve productions. Published books include ‘Brincos y saltos: el juego como disciplina teatral’ and ‘Historias para ser contadas, montaje de Rosa Luisa Márquez.’ She is a member of the board of directors and pedagogical team for the EITALC´s International School of Latin American and Caribbean Theater. Ongoing artistic collaborators include Gilda Navarra and Antonio Martorell (Puerto Rico), Grupo Malayerba (Ecuador), Grupo Yuyachkani (Peru), and directors Peter Shumann (Bread & Puppet Theater, U.S.A.) and Augusto Boal (Theater of the Oppressed, Brazil). ‘Historias para ser contadas,’ directed by
Márquez and created in collaboration with Antonio Martorell and the
University of Puerto Rico’s Teatro Rodante, pays homage to renowned
Argentinean theater director, writer and activist Osvaldo Dragún. Like a
three-ring circus, the play is performed in three different styles: ‘La
historia de un flemón, una mujer y dos hombres’ is told by the ‘Prince
of Denmark’s Actors Troupe,’ an ensemble of characters from Western
drama masterpieces –Hamlet, Oedipus, Charlotte Corday, Colombina, among
others; ‘La historia de cómo Panchito se sintió responsable de la
epidemia de peste bubónica en África del Sur’ is performed by a troupe
of clowns/ mechanics in an old van-turned-puppet-theater, influenced by
Naïve artists and pop culture; ‘La historia del hombre que se convirtió
en perro’ is told –and sung- by a group of Bohemians straight from the
70’s Puerto Rican nightlife.

520 bb $a Interview with Marcos Malafaia, one of the directors of Brazilian puppet
theater company Giramundo, conducted by Marcos Alexandre in the context of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics’ 5th Encuentro, ‘Performing
Heritage’, celebrated in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in March of 2005. In this
interview Malafaia discusses the origins and history of the group, their
construction and manipulation techniques, and the influences and genres at
play in Giramundo’s ongoing research, creation, performance and pedagogy.
The artist also discusses the points of contact between arts and politics
in the process of performing Brazilian heritage, paying special attention
to four renowned plays by Giramundo: ‘Tiradentes’, ‘O Guarani’, Os
Orixás’, and ‘Cobra Norato’. Finally, Malafai comments on
Giramundo’s latest spectacle, ‘Pinocchio’, an adaptation of Carlo
Collodi’s text to puppet theater. Created in 1970 by Brazilian artists
Álvaro Apocalypse, Terezinha Veloso and Maria do Carmo Vivacqua Martins
(Madu), Giramundo Teatro de Bonecos (www.giramundo.org) has gained
worldwide recognition as one of the most important puppet theater groups in
the world. Their remarkable trajectory includes professional works for
theater, film, video, and television, as well as a strong pedagogical
component, teaching workshops and puppetry courses both abroad and in their
own school in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The 950 marionettes that they have
already staged or that are still on stage are part of the Museu Giramundo
collection, which has the largest private collection of the kind in Brazil.
The methodological rigor in creating their performances, the refined
construction and manipulation of their performing objects, and their
interest in exploring topics in Brazilian culture have provided Giramundo
with tools for transcending traditional children’s theater in order to
incorporate adult themes and cultural forms in direct dialogue with complex
political and aesthetic issues.

520 bb $a Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino (www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their ‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and
cultural perceptions. ‘La Virgen del Tepeyac’ is ETC’s longest
running play and is cherished by audience members who come from all around
the world to see it performed at the historic old mission of San Juan
Bautista, California. Performed every other year since 1971 in concert with
‘La Pastorela,’ this Christmas pageant was adapted from a
four-character liturgical drama written by an anonymous Mexican or Spanish
monk in the 18th Century. Valdez reworked the original story to include new
characters and scenes, and also introduced music and dance. Importantly,
the piece includes Aztec song and dance, adding complex layers to this
pageant which embraces both Catholic and Indigenous rituals. Dramatizing
the four apparitions of the Virgin of Guadalupe to the indio Juan Diego on
the hill of Tepeyac outside Mexico City in 1531, the play climaxes with the
miracle of the roses that sealed the conversion of pre-Columbian Mexico to
Christianity. The appearance of the Virgen de Guadalupe stands as a beacon,
a shining ray of light and hope, across the centuries of darkness and
injustice, for the indios of the Americas.

the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and
cultural perceptions. ‘Power to the People’ was created in 2001 by
Lakin Valdez, Kinan Valdez and Ruben Gonzalez. The play is a response to
the incidents involving Enron, PG&E and California Governor Gray Davis in
2001, in which a false power crisis created by Enron (who had recently
begun to sell power to PG&E) resulted in increased power bills and rolling
blackouts for California residents. It was later discovered that there was
no power crisis, and California residents felt that Governor Davis had
responded poorly to the situation –this and other circumstances led to
the historic recall election when Governor Davis lost to Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger. The creators of the piece wanted to re-examine the
historical roots of the Deregulation Bill of 1996. The aesthetic of the
‘Power to the People’ follows the original ETC style of ‘actos,’
which the group originally used in the fields during the farmworkers'
strikes in Delano, California during the 1960s. This acto was performed up
and down California, in collaboration with the Power to the People
Coalition. This is a good representation of the future generation of El
Teatro Campesino while simultaneously representing ETC’s past.

520 bb $a Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El Teatro Campesino (www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their ‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political and
cultural perceptions. This video documents their piece ‘Solidarity por
Vida.’ Like ‘Power to the People,’ this piece takes after the
original ETC tradition of performing ‘actos’ in the fields of Delano,
California during the farmworkers’ strikes during the 1960s.  It
represents ETC’s newer generation’s interpretation of the acto style
and was created through the structured writing of Kinan Valdez and Luis
Juarez in addition to improvisational methods involving the cast. 
‘Solidarity por Vida’ deals with issues of migration, border crossing
and the militarization of the Mexican-American border (particularly in
Arizona) during the beginning of 2001.  The play’s theme would prove to
be prophetic, having been written before the issue garnered major media
attention in 2006.  This production was performed outdoors in San Isidro,
Mexico on the border of San Diego, California in April 2001, in the context
of a day-long program of political performance that brought together
multiple performance groups including ETC.

Miguel Rubio Zapata and masterfully performed by Teresa Ralli of the Grupo
Cultural Yuyachkani (Peru) in the context of the first Encuentro of the
Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil in 2000. This one-woman performance of José Watanabe’s version of
Sophocles’ classic tragedy is a breathtakingly sad example of the
devastation twenty years of civil violence in Peru caused; although it is
the story of only one character, it speaks for the nearly 70,000
disappeared men, women and children of Peru. Peru’s most important
theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971
at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and
collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am
thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theater group has
devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory,
particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in
Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so
called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots
community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s
National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both
indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms,
Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to
broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

body training stresses body memory, composition and accumulation.  This
pedagogical demonstration also includes aspects of character development,
discussing the relationships between everyday body practices and bodies
onstage; weight, balance, volume, flows of energy and centers of balance,
showcased in this demonstration, are central aspects in Yuyachkani’s
(re)search of what they term an ‘actor múltiple’ or ‘multiple

conducted by Diana Taylor in the context of the first Encuentro of the
Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil in 2000. Ralli discusses the role of women in Yuyachkani in the
context of issues of politics and gender in Peru. Topics covered include
women’s role in society, the difficulty of making a living as
professional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists’
work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection about
these roles and also the space to play with/challenge them.  For the
artist, theater has been a space for personal growth, aesthetic
exploration, and social intervention.  Teresa talks about the interplay
between Yuyachkani’s workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issues
of sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances,
and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internal
workings of Yuyachkani and with their audience.  She comments on the
Encuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought together
various Peruvian female performers of Peru), the celebration of the Primer
Festival Teatro Mujer (the first major theater festival by women in Peru),
the creative and political environment surrounding the creation of
Yuyachkani’s all-women piece ‘La primera cena’ (directed by Ralli),
and the role Peruvian women play in the creation and performance of her
one-woman piece ‘Antígona’. Peru’s most important theater
collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the
forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and
collective creation. The theater group has devoted itself to the collective

Non-Actors’, ‘Rainbow of Desire’, ’Legislative Theater’, among
others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996.
Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical
form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up
alongside Paulo Freire's ‘Pedagogy of the Oppressed.’ Theater of the
Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at
developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in
order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the
society that engenders those oppressions. The word 'oppressed' is used in the
sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs,
and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It
must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of
fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds
of discrimination. In this workshop and keynote address, celebrated in the
context of in the context of the first Encuentro of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in
2000, Boal talks about the history and coordinates of the Theater of the
Oppressed. He also shares with the participants some of the ludic exercises
included in ‘Games for Actors and Non-Actors’. The workshop ends with a
demonstration of Forum Theater, with performances by two groups linked to
the Centro de Teatro do Oprimido: Grupo Artimanha (on issues of AIDS and
homosexuality) and Grupo Panela de Oppresão (on the forced displacement of

520 bb $a Augusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian 
theatrical
director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on 
of
the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is 
the
author of ‘Theater of the Oppressed’, ‘Games for Actors 
and
Non-Actors’, ‘Rainbow of Desire’, ’Legislative Theater’, 
among
others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 
1993-1996.
Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political 
theatrical
form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing 
up
alongside Paulo Freire's ‘Pedagogy of the Oppressed.’ Theater of 
the
Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims 
at
developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, 
in
order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform 
the
society that engenders those oppressions. The word 'oppressed' is used in 
the
sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and 
needs,
and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. 
It
must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool 
of
fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all 
kinds
of discrimination. In this workshop and keynote address, celebrated in

520 bb $a Susana Cook (www.susanacook.com) is a New York-based Argentinean theater and performance artist.
Mainly directed to queer and Latino communities in New York City, Cook's
work also encompasses a heated response to broader State policies that
oppress communities defined in the intersection of race, gender, and class.
In her shows, Cook parodies discourses of power, drawing attention to the
close ties between the state, religious and political conservatism, and the
military. Cook's plays usually feature all-women casts that defy the
normative performance of gender, race, and sexuality. Her piece ‘Butch
Fashion Show in the Femme Auto Body Shop’ was performed at Dixon Pace in
the context of the HOT Festival in July, 1997. The performance, a
collaboration between Susana and artist Lisa Haas, is comprised of scenes
previously worked for a cabaret by Cook’s Tango Lesbiango company called
‘The Service Economy Vaudeville.’ It is a witty, satirical exploration
of the ups, downs, and sexual charades at play in an urban butch-femme
relationship.

520 bb $a It is the summer of 1973, and the United Farm Workers are fighting 
for
their lives. Led by Cesar Chavez, a march comes to Burlap, California, 
a
fictional tank town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. This is 
the
background for playwright, director and El Teatro Campesino’s 
founder
Luis Valdez’ vintage classic, ‘Mundo Mata,’ a period piece 
that
exposes the raw realities of life in a small farmworker town. As part of 
an
epic struggle to achieve victory in union elections among ranches up 
and
down the state, the campaign in Burlap brings together two brothers 
and
pulls them apart. One is Bullet Mata, who returns to his old hometown 
for
the first time in twelve years; the other, his older brother Mundo is 
a
Vietnam veteran. Bullet is a college dropout, turned Chavista sworn 
to
non-violence. Mundo is a drug dealer, secretly hired by two growers to 
stop
Chavez. While the issue of violence versus non-violence becomes a 
personal
matter between the two brothers, ‘Mundo Mata’ also resonates within 
a
larger landscape of the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. What 
if
Cesar Chavez had been assassinated in 1973? Would history remember 
him
differently? These are some of the questions implied in this gritty 
drama
about the farmworkers’ struggle for justice. ‘Mundo Mata’ 
premiered
in 1976 in El Paso, Texas in the Chamizal Theater on the borderline 
with
Juarez, Mexico. After being retired, the play was revived, rewritten 
and
restaged, as documented in this 2001 production. Founded in 1965 by Luis 
Valdez, El Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the
workers, who could neither read nor write, but recognized themselves 
and
their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and 
to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore 
and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions.

520 bb $a This video documents El Teatro Campesino’s performance 
‘Mummified
Deer’. The play was inspired by a 1984 newspaper article describing 
an
86-year-old woman in Juarez, Mexico who was found to be carrying 
a
60-year-old mummified fetus in her womb. Fifteen years later, 
playwright,
director and founder of ETC Luis Valdez returned to the article 
while
simultaneously embarking on a highly personal investigation of his 
own
family history. Valdez traveled to Sonora, Mexico to investigate 
his
family’s Yaqui roots and ancestral history; ‘Mummified Deer’ 
derived
from his time in Mexico and the newspaper article, in what Valdez 
considers
to be his most personal play to date. Armida, Valdez’s mother, 
is
re-envisioned as a young woman by the same name; his grandmothers, 
aunts
and cousins fused into the other leading characters. The main action of 
the
play takes place in 1999 by the side of Mama Chu’s hospital bed, but 
also
flashes back to 1969 when the Chicano Movement was just starting, 
back
through the thirties and twenties, to the turn of the 20th Century and 
the
Mexican Revolution when Mama Chu crosses the border into the United 
States.
The genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico, forcing Mama Chu to 
migrate
to the US, is only one of the family’s buried secrets. In spite of 
the
fluidity of time zones, what anchors all the action is the constant
presence of a young Yaqui deer dancer who dances but does not 
speak,
symbolizing the 60-year-old mummified fetus. The play incorporates 
themes
of family conflict within the broader context of history and 
social
struggle. Staged two years after the original production at the San 
Diego
Repertory Theater, this version of ‘Mummified Deer’ contains 
several
changes and refinements to the script. Founded in 1965 by Luis Valdez, El 
Teatro Campesino 
(www.elteatrocampesino.com) was initially the
cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's 
central
valley. With a pointed political mission, ETC performed  their 
‘actos’
in the fields, agitprop improvisations communicated eloquently with 
the

Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early

Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early

and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions. This video documents ETC’s play ‘Bernabé.’
Written in 1970 and revived in 2000, the action of the piece takes place 
in
the small fictional town of Burlap, located in the central San 
Joaquin
Valley of California. With a population of only a couple of thousand
inhabitants, Burlap is the hometown of Bernabé, a mentally retarded 
farm
worker who is ‘touched by cosmic madness.’ The performance takes 
us
from the sun-baked reality of the valley into the mythological darkness 
of
Bernabe’s mind. The abstract set reflects the world of its 
protagonist,
blending myth and reality, above and below the surface of the 
earth.
Burlap, California is also the setting for another Luis Valdez’ 
play,
‘Mundo Mata,’ a period piece that exposes the raw realities of life 
in
a small farmworker town.

their values in the actos. By 1970 ETC had gained an international
reputation, with major contributions to Chicano culture in the U.S. and 
to
the development and expansion of the boundaries of theater everywhere.
Theirs is a popular theater rooted in the American streets, early
California history, Mayan/Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore 
and
spiritualism, all geared toward expression of social, political 
and
cultural perceptions. ‘La Carpa de los Rasquachis’ was originally
produced in 1974, and underwent several revisions until 1976, when it 
was
locked into the definitive version seen in this revival performed by a 
new
generation of ETC actors more than twenty years after its premiere. 
The
‘carpa’ (itinerant tent show) presents the epic life story 
of
farmworkers in America. Told through the struggles, frustrations 
and
ultimate victory of a single Chicano, the Rasquachi saga (‘working-class’,
‘underdog’) comes alive in corridos (Mexica ballads) that tell 
of
life’s tragedies with an ironic, rollicking earthy good humor. The 
story
follows Jesus Pelado Rasquachi, leaving his own mother and brother 
in
Mexico as he heads for the United States, in hopes of ‘getting rich’ 
as
a bracero. Misfortune and fate, however, stalks his every footstep, in 
the
guise of El Diablo and La Calavera. Tricked and betrayed at every 
turn,
Jesus Pelado becomes a pathetic comic figure in the hands of the 
growers,
contractors, bar owners, and social workers, and ultimately, 
the
undertaker.

The Argentinean Grupo Etcétera has created the ‘Internacional errorista.’ In their own words, ‘Errorism was born from an error: In times of censorship, we see ourselves subjected to force our language, to take metaphors to their maximum limit, to say without naming. Not being able to use the words ‘(T)errorism’ or ‘(T)errorist’ due to their symbolic weight and the ‘danger’ that this represents, we escape into wordplay. That’s how Errorism was born: in error.’

Ámericas: Formaciones de Raza, Clase y Género / Body Politics in the Americas: Formations of Race, Class and
Gender’. The computer is now an irreversible part of how improvisation
has become a site for interdisciplinary exploration, exchanges of personal
and cultural narratives, and the blurring of boundaries between art forms.
For George Lewis, living, working, and performing with creative machines of
his own design is closely intertwined with the study of how improvisation
produces knowledge and meaning. Part memoir, part history and criticism,
the talk intersects with critical histories of new media and American
experimentalism, as well as ethnographic and historical work on
improvisation. George E. Lewis (music.columbia.edu/faculty/lewis.html) is
an improviser-trombonist, composer, and computer/installation artist. He is
the Edwin H. Case Professor of American Music at Columbia University. His
book, ‘Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental
Music’ is forthcoming from the University of Chicago Press.

unequal distribution of wealth and, especially, of risk, the politics of

socioanthropology of affect, this lecture examines the centrality of
fear/terror/panic and the affect they produce (hatred, rage, sorrow, hope)
in/between/on the social body. More than an inventory of traits and

sociopolitical and cultural impact of these processes in the

‘Small House’, two explorers lay claim to the same territory. These

watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change. Their only hope is

subject of immigration. The immigrant is a divided being. A being marked by
having crossed to the other side, always aware of ‘here’ and
‘there,’ ‘before’ and ‘after.’ After the moment of crossing,
the immigrant is never the same.

with their death.

which the poet confesses was the only poem she ever wrote for pleasure and
for herself. As she strips away the levels of the poem, she also strips
away her clothes. Jesusa Rodríguez (www.elhabito.com.mx) is Mexico’s
leading cabaret and political performance artist, who ran the famous ‘El
Hábito’ in Mexico City with her wife Liliana Felipe. She is the

victim -of not being able to deal with circumstances, or not being able to
deal with a secret nature that forces us to complain. This video includes a

ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase

520 bb $a Video documentation of Manuel Mendive’s ‘Para el ojo que mira,’ an interdisciplinary performance held at the opening of Mendive’s eponymous art exhibit at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana in August of 1987. An ambitious, syncretic, critically acclaimed show that included mixed media paintings, sculptures, masks, and performance, ‘Para el ojo que mira’ opened with an exuberant public body art performance created by Mendive, with the participation of musicians and dancers from the Conjunto Folklórico Nacional and the Danza Nacional de Cuba, along with the guest appearance of Lázaro Ross, one of the most important contemporary interpreters of Yoruba music in this Caribbean island. This video documentation was directed by Lourdes Prieto. Manuel Mendive Hoyo (www.mendive.cult.cu) is perhaps the single most important Cuban artist today. Mendive, a major exponent of contemporary ‘Afro-cubanismo’ in the visual arts, was born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family. He graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Plásticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting. He held his first one-man show at the Center of Art in Havana in 1964. Since then he has exhibited in some of the most important international venues. The Cuban booth at the XLII International Biennial Exhibition of Modern Art in Venice in 1988 was completely dedicated to his works. His work can be found in Museums and galleries in many countries including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, the Musee d’Art Moderne in Paris; as well as museums in Russia, Somalia, Congo, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the U.S and other countries. He is well-known not only for his painting and soft sculpture, but for his performance pieces in which he paints dancers’ naked bodies and creates theatrical backdrops and environments. Representing an important strain of Cuban life, Mendive's multi-media work reflects his syncretic take on religion, philosophy, ethnography, art and dance.

520 bb $a ‘Amarillo, azul y blanco,’ a video by Ramón García, documents a traveling, public performance art event created by renowned Cuban artist Manuel Mendive. Brightly-painted dancing bodies journey through Lenin Park (Havana), San Juan river (Matanzas) and Oasis Hotel (Varadero) in a performance of embodied syncretism, a dance of colors –'yellow, blue and white,' the title of the piece- echoing both the basic language of visual artists and the distinctive colors of Santería deities –the colors of Ochún, Yemayá and Changó. Mendive blends significant elements of Afro-Cuban culture, creating a personal universe intimately linked to his particular worldview, one that establishes organic connections between nature and religion, African ancestry and Caribbean everyday life, a symphony of syncretism that, like all of Mendive’s art, reflects a life of commitment to African spiritual practices, a commitment that became more intense after his first visits to Africa in the early 1980s. Manuel Mendive Hoyo (www.mendive.cult.cu) is perhaps the single most important Cuban artist today. Mendive, a major exponent of contemporary ‘Afro-cubanismo’ in the visual arts, was born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family.

In this performance, brightly-colored bodies streak through the streets of Havana, shouting and gesturing wildly, dancing in sync, carrying ducks. Aaron Vega's video documents this exuberant public body art performance, including scenes of Mendive's unique method of preparing the performers: painting some with bright animals and abstract shapes, and covering others entirely in one color.

520 bb $a Inspired by the ‘Glamours’ text of Alice Bailey, Deborah Hunt’s
‘Las Mirillas’ talks about the attraction to illusion. A pilgrim,
fisherman, guard, sleepwalker, witness and market woman shared two store
windows and the space in between to explore the distortion of perception.
The video projections allowed the public to see them in their natural
habitats. This is Deborah Hunt’s fourth work in the shop windows of an
art supplies store in Santurce. It forms part of the body of work created
by the artist in these windows as a response to having no permit to perform
in the plazas (public squares) of San Juan. The spaces were small. It
rained. The audience crept closer to huddle around the fire of the pilgrim.

520 bb $a The experimental multimedia mask-and-puppet theater piece ‘Cloche y el
Cuervo II: El Regreso’ is a reply to Deborah Hunt’s ‘Cloche y el
Cuervo’ the story of an unlikely hero. Cloche, who receives a letter, is
propelled along a bizarre journey where his alter egos take the form of
seductively malicious crows bent on his destruction. The audience of the
first piece liked the crows more than Cloche. Hunt thought they had missed
the point so she and her troupe filmed the crow characters in black and
white and created seven Cloches….and their revenge or rather
counterbattle. Deborah Hunt is a maskmaker, puppeteer and performance

520 bb $a Maskmaker, puppeteer and performance artist Deborah Hunt lives in Barrio
San Mateo, in Santurce, part of the greater metropolitan area of San Juan,
Puerto Rico. In 2005, one half of the barrio was expropriated by the
Housing Department of Puerto Rico, and although in the early days there was
talk of mixed income housing, etc., the move to clear the area of its long
time residents to make way for luxury apartments and to ‘revitalize’
the area was an example of the greed and corrupt maneuvering of government,
developers and the most important banking institute on the island. As part
of the resistance to this sick undertaking, residents, artists and
activists stopped machines, went to court and created murals and
performance events. The Museo del Barrio was the focus of the effort. Using
objects from the empty houses Deborah Hunt and her performance
collaborators performed ‘animas’ in an abandoned ‘zaguán.’ The
masks became a symbol for the people who had left, silent witnesses who
later appeared on walls and protested in other public spaces. The area
remained barren and empty. The few remaining trees had withered and died.
They believe the area to be cursed. Deborah Hunt is a maskmaker, puppeteer
and performance artist with 35 years experience in the creation and
presentation of original theater and performance works. She has worked in
New Zealand, USA, England, Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, British
Windward Islands, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, Belgrade, Venezuela, Cuba,
Spain, Singapore, Australia, and has been working bilingually
(English/Spanish) since 1985. Hunt also teaches puppetry and maskwork,
offering intensive laboratories lasting from a weekend to nine-months long.

520 bb $a 'Migrants! Cantata a los emigrantes' is a bilingual play with music celebrating the Puerto Rican pioneers who established communities in the United States and struggled for the preservation of their culture. At the time the play was created there were 2.6 million Puerto Ricans in the United States, with 1.6 million in New York alone. Puerto Ricans have been pushed and pulled ever since the United States took the island in 1898. Some have stayed and given birth to a second and third generation; some have returned to the island and others are still in never ending transit between here and there. With this collective creation, Pregones weaves through various social, historical, economical and personal factors that have influenced their migratory process. 'Migrants' is Pregones’ homage to the courage and endurance of those who came and worked before us. The play was created collectively by Pregones Theater, based on written and oral history, interviews and the works of writers such as Guillermo Boralt, René Marqués and Klemente Soto Beles. It was premiered at Pregones Theater at St. Ann’s in The Bronx, NY, in December 1986. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor’s Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company’s repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

520 bb $a 'Voces de Acero' is a collective creation incorporating movement, theater, poetry and music about the will to survive in a world of uniform color, uniform smell and uniform lighting. When the play was created (1990) there were more than 150 political activists connected to Left-wing movements, serving sentences in federal prisons throughout the United States. Alejandrina Torres, a Puerto Rican independence activist accused of seditious conspiracy, tried and sentenced to 35 years, was one of the 4 women designated to serve time in the Lexington Control Unit – a 100 foot long block with 16 cells, completely self-contained and classified as a High Security Unit (HSU). The Lexington HSU signified the emergence of a new strategy in detention aimed at political transformation via isolation, extensive surveillance, and sensory deprivation. The characters in the play are inspired by Torres and the other 21 Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. jails under similar circumstances. All characters are fictitious. The focus of the production is allegorical and not didactic. The design is stark and evocative of the isolation and timelessness imperative in the HSU. The work was the result of an extensive process of improvisation and experimentation. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W.

520 bb $a 'The Embrace' deals, in a very different way, with the effects produced by AIDS in the Latino community and focuses on the importance of taking active participation in the presented scenes and suggesting changes through action. The production grew out of Pregones’ work with Brazilian Augusto Boal, particularly as an adaptation of his Forum Theater techniques. The production toured over 100 community sites in East Harlem & The Bronx in New York, and in New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The presentations were designed to promote direct audience participation in order to heighten awareness and develop sensitivity to persons with AIDS and their families. A health counselor always traveled with the production to answer audience questions and to offer information on HIV transmission and adoption of AIDS risk-reduction behavior.

520 bb $a Framed by two male figures dressed in tuxedos, a Puerto Rican woman relives the timeless folktales of love and wisdom told by the women of her family for generations. She is a passionate poet and writer, invested in celebrating her own heritage while at the same time challenging the definitions of womanhood and romance passed on by generations of women in her family. She constantly navigates the dual identity formed by having grown up in two very different worlds: the tropical island and ‘Los Nuevayores’ (that other place away from the island.) By way of her grandmother, she is a skilled and eloquent storyteller. Her companions are two parts of the same man, one being Spanish dominant and the other English dominant. They both give life to the eternal inhabitant of the poetic world created by the writer: a Latino leading man. They are able to embody her varying definitions of manhood. Form a menacing thief that terrorized the Caribbean during the 18th Century, to a gentle young man brought up as a girl by his widowed mother, to the author’s memory of her father.

Riding the subway uptown towards El Barrio, and eager to witness the birth of his firstborn, a Puerto Rican man and his best friend face the Northeast Blackout of 1965. A paean to the courage, humor, and humanity of migrant experience, the show has been hailed by critics as ‘the quintessential Boricua play.’ 'El Apagón' has been performed throughout the United States, and in Puerto Rico, Slovakia, and Holland. This video documents Pregones’ first iteration of ‘El Apagón,’ as premiered at Pregones @ St. Ann’s in the Spring of 1992.

To the popular rhythms of bomba and plena, Merced is accompanied by Judith Rivera on vocals and narration and guest stars Los Pleneros de la 21.

520 bb $a In the eye of a storm, far from anywhere, a man and a woman hang on to life. The decision at hand: reach the other shore, return, or abandon all hope. ‘La otra orilla’ is based on the play ‘Obra póstuma’ by Eusebio Colange, resident playwright of the theater group La Zaranda in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. It is inspired in the tragedy of many lives lost in the Caribbean waters. Pregones infuses the playwright’s words with the company’s signature live music and physical vocabulary, and creates new characters anchored in the experience/history of Latinos in the U.S. ‘This work means a lot to us, as it addresses painful issues connected to migration. Thousands of Puerto Ricans have left Puerto Rico over the years, many other thousands have gone back. Many have been born here and with to connect with their other shore. Many don’t want to leave at all. Hundreds of Dominican, Cuban and Haitian people die as their boats sink in the Caribbean waters; many of them also make it to the other shore. Collectively, we have proven that we rise against adversity, our resistance growing each day. We hope that the play will touch our audience, and that, wherever your other shore may be, you be happy with the discovery.’ The production was premiered at the Repertory Theater of Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture in The Bronx, on June, 1996. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor’s Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company’s repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

520 bb $a ‘Promise of a Love Song’ is a collaborative play developed from a four-year exchange between Roadside Theater of Kentucky, Junebug Productions of New Orleans, and Pregones Theater of the South Bronx, and their home communities.  A cast of twelve musicians and actors from the three companies meet on stage to discover how rhythms, music, movement and stories illuminate the strengths, struggles, similarities, and differences of three peoples – African American, Puerto Rican, and Appalachian. It is a play about love; a tapestry of stories told from very specific realities and worlds. The stories are: ‘Star-Crossed Lovers’ (Junebug Productions), ‘Silent Dancing’ (Pregones Theater), and ‘Charming Billy’ (Roadside Theater). Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries.

one-woman piece created and performed by Teresa Hernández exploring the
theme of Self. Seduced by the contradictions at play in the
impossibility of speaking of ‘self’ without referencing an ‘other,'
the artist performs seven skits (divided in two acts, ‘Post-infarto’
and ‘Parada’) combining monologues, experimental dance, and video, as a
sort of autobiography-in-flux, an exercise that questions even the very
process of autobiographical introspection. In the piece, the grammatical
first person (common in autobiography) blends with the third person, in a
masquerade of characters through which chameleonic Hernández presents the
hard lessons of what it entails, in this day and age, to be an experimental
stage artist in Puerto Rico. Teresa Hernández is a Puerto Rican stage artist. Since 1987 she
has written, directed and performed contemporary theater and dance, both in
Puerto Rico’s commercial and experimental art scenes. Teresa’s creative
projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing of traditional
artistic categories. Theater, dance, performance, dramatic text, movement,
costumes, video and everyday objects are juxtaposed and confronted, placed
in a liminal space where notions of precariousness are explored and
celebrated. Teresa’s characters explore and expose the anxieties of
everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversally investigating issues
of gender, class and race.

520 bb $a ‘La muchacha de los libros usados’ tells the story of a girl whose
family sold her to a soldier. Her life then unravels as a series of
experiences related to the organized, symmetrical life of the army. Still
almost a child, the girl is forced by the soldier to live in the barracks,
treating her like a prized object. The night he decides to engage in sexual
intercourse with her, the girl runs away and is hit by a bus. While
struggling between life and death, the girl looks back over events in her
life, realizing the symmetries at play in most people’s lives, as well as
the levels of control and repression enacted by people. The moment she
supposedly recovers, she decides to leave her husband/buyer for good. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal ‘Hoja de Teatro,’ conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

520 bb $a ‘La razón blindada’ is based on the classic novel ‘El Quijote’ by
Miguel de Cervantes, Franz Kafka’s ‘The Truth about Sancho Panza,’
and testimonies by Chicho Vargas and other political prisoners held in the
1970’s at the Rawson Prison during Argentina’s dictatorship. In the
play, two political prisoners, oppressed by physical and emotional abuse,
find solace in meeting every Sunday at dusk to tell the story of Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza. Their storytelling unravels amidst the extreme
limitations imposed by their condition of inmates in a maximum security
prison. It is fueled by the vital need to tell each other a story that
could save them, that could transport them to a human adventure situated in
the realm of imagination, where hardship and fear can’t reach them, where
the most intense pain can be mitigated by the act of imagining a different
reality. In this way, they continuously reinvent Don Quixote, the
knight-errant who constantly takes windmills for giants, withered women for
maidens, and prisons for paradises, a character who exiles himself in
insanity, that strange state of harmless straggle, an oblique strategy for
survival.

520 bb $a ‘La razón blindada’ is based on the classic novel ‘El 
Quijote’ by
Miguel de Cervantes, Franz Kafka’s ‘The Truth about Sancho 
Panza,’
and testimonies by Chicho Vargas and other political prisoners held in 
the
1970’s at the Rawson Prison during Argentina’s dictatorship. In 
the
play, two political prisoners, oppressed by physical and emotional 
abuse,
find solace in meeting every Sunday at dusk to tell the story of 
Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza. Their storytelling unravels amidst the 
extreme
limitations imposed by their condition of inmates in a maximum 
security
prison. It is fueled by the vital need to tell each other a story 
that
could save them, that could transport them to a human adventure situated 
in
the realm of imagination, where hardship and fear can’t reach them, 
where
the most intense pain can be mitigated by the act of imagining a 
different
reality. In this way, they continuously reinvent Don Quixote, 
the
knight-errant who constantly takes windmills for giants, withered women 
for
maidens, and prisons for paradises, a character who exiles himself 
in
insanity, that strange state of harmless straggle, an oblique strategy 
for
survival. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in 
Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 
‘Charo’ Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. 
From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and 
nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and 
complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political 
violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing 
theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally 
for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and 
experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have 
represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have 
also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, 
and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in 
Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the 
training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing 
investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 
Malayerba launched the theater journal ‘Hoja de Teatro,’ conceived as a 
forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater 
practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which 
houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy

520 bb $a ‘Nuestra Señora de las Nubes’ (subtitled as an ’exercise on
exile’) tells the story of the encounters of two political exiles, Oscar
and Bruna, who meet in a nondescript place and time to share memories of
their homeland, an ethereal, fictional town called Nuestra Señora de las
Nubes (Our Lady of the Clouds). Constantly alternating between present
realities and past memories, and with two pieces of luggage as sole
belongings, the characters share anecdotes of their experience as exiles,
their dreams, needs, frustrations, desires, loves, oblivions and memories.
A town that only exists in the memory of expatriates, Nuestra Señora maps
the experience of diaspora as an existential condition of permanent
uprootedness, in this case inspired by the history of Latin American exile.
Exile, in this work, becomes not only the physical loss of one's homeland,
but the erosion of one's ability to remain inside one's own memories.
Memory as a sort of joint venture, then, allows for the construction of a
new territory to belong to, a new homeland of affect where to survive,
yearn and remember.

improvisations by actresses María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés and
Rosa Luisa Márquez, the directorial and dramaturgical vision of Arístides
Vargas, and the visual and spatial transformations by Puerto Rican artist
Antonio Martorell, the play portrays the close relationship between two
friends, developed in multiple encounters through time and space in the
slippery territory of memory.  The characters share the encounters and

incommunication, censorship, indifference and violence. Between life and
death, memories and games, Catalina and Miranda weave their relationship,
turning friendship into a community of affect, a virtual homeland of
solidarity where to live amidst political and spiritual exile. Music by

character, an Angel of Death of sorts) complements their journey between

520 bb $a A group of writers are in the habit of gathering in a public library to
engage in creative writing and to exchange opinions about their musings.
Gradually, life and fiction merge into a discourse blending experiences
lived and imagined. Themes like love, death and revolution are lived and
recreated in a constant game of imagination; the characters defend the
library as a space of fantasy against the real world outside. The only
reference we have of this outside world is a constant rain of ashes –we
could suspect it being Quito, Ecuador, where volcanic ashes shower the
city, but this is only an ambiguous allusion, for this library can exist
anywhere and nowhere. This video documents key excerpts from Malayerba's renowned production.

520 bb $a José, a man who has lost his memory, wanders along a country that he no
longer feels his own, a place that no longer holds affective ties, personal
memories linking him to a community. One day he meets Toña, a woman of
great kindness, alienated due to a profound lack of affection. She tells
him that in a nearby beach, many years ago, people used to go to sleep and
dream a collective dream and that, in this dream, theirs pasts and the
characters who lived there show up once again. José, conflicted by his
loss of memory decides to go to this beach to dream in order to build, out
of dreams, his lost identity. ‘Jardín de pulpos’ (‘Octopus’s
Garden’) is a journey through memory and identity, a painful metaphor of
losses and absences, a space of the subconscious where Latin America’s
collective imagery wanders amidst its struggles, exiles, and
oblivion. This video documents key excerpts from Malayerba's renowned production. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal ‘Hoja de Teatro,’ conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

520 bb $a ‘Pluma y la tempestad’ tells the story of a youngster (who could be a
boy or a girl), born in a hostile world, growing up on the streets like a
boat adrift, like a feather in the storm (‘como pluma en la
tempestad’), tossed and turned by the ever-changing gusts of life. It is
the story of a marginalized person, exposed to all kinds of dangers,
coerced to sell out, to compromise, to resign himself, but still, against
all odds, chooses self-affirmation and the development of her own
individuality, struggling to survive and go on, recycling the debris left
by the storm. ‘Pluma’ poses a critique on society’s political,
religious and pedagogical institutions. A strange parable on what it
entails being different, misunderstood, marginalized by society, Pluma is
also a spiritual hermaphrodite of sorts, a metaphor for the idealist, a
subject full of hope but unable to succeed, to express himself, to belong,
to be a welcomed member of society. This video documents key excerpts form Malayerba's renowned production.

520 bb $a ‘La Fanesca’ is one of the very first plays created by Ecuadorian
theater group Malayerba. Collectively created in 1984 under the direction
of founding member Susana Pautasso, the play is based on texts by María
Escudero. A ‘fanesca’ is a traditional Ecuadorian dish, a rich soup
made of a variety of ingredients, typically prepared and served only in the
week before Easter; this play is inspired on this traditional dish,
bringing together carnivalesque characters from the diversity of cultures
and ethnicities present in Ecuadorian society. The performance portrays, by
means of the masked voices of society’s underdogs, the fractured,
unofficial history of Ecuador and its rich cultural heritage as a ‘mezcla
de todo’ (a ‘mixture of everything’): the diverse worldviews,
cultures, and backgrounds, not only of native Ecuadorians but also of the
migrants and exiles assimilated –or not- to Ecuadorian society. This
video documents the performance of ‘La Fanesca’ as presented in the

Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés, in the context of their play ‘La
Fanesca’ performed at the Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro (FIT) de
Cádiz, held in Spain in 1987. In this interview, Charo talks about the
origins and creative process of 'La Fanesca,’ as well as the history of
the Malayerba theater group. The actress also comments on the reception of
the play by Latin American audiences and on the experience of performing
this play in Europe in the context of the Festival. Francés discusses
issues of collective creation and political and artistic investigation at
the Malayerba, as well as the role migration and exile have played in
the life of the group, both as a concrete life experience for the actors
and as a topic for their interventions in Ecuadorian theater and society.
The actress illustrates these topics through her impressions of being a
Spaniard exiled in Quito, doing Ecuadorian theater that is, in turn,
performed in Spain. This interview is invaluable documentation of the early
stages of this renowned theater group, one of the most important theater
ensembles and actor laboratories in Latin America. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain.

520 bb $a ‘Bicicleta Lerux’ presents the life of Ulises, a domestic Ulysses who
never leaves home and whose travels are limited to wandering between the
living room, the kitchen and the bathroom, in a personal Odyssey of memory.
Penelope, in the meantime, unravels Ulises’ journey, revealing an
intimate life full of absences. The voyage is triggered by Lerux –a
person? a place? an idea?-, which stirs Ulises’ deepest feelings and
emotions. ‘Bicicleta Lerux’ was inspired by the powerful motif of
Ulysses’ Odyssey.  While not intending to recreate the classic Greek
myth, the play explores the human aspects of this quest, turning a mythical
voyage into an everyday human experience, mapping out the ‘geography’
of a person’s life–the chasms of tragedies endured, the distant, gentle
slopes of happiness enjoyed.

520 bb $a ‘Malayerba: 25 años de teatro’ is a documentary prepared by this
Ecuadorian theater ensemble as an overview of the first 25 years of
artistic trajectory. Weaving interviews with founding members and artistic
directors María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés and Arístides Vargas,
and illustrated through video and photo documentation, the documentary
portrays the history and creative coordinates of the Grupo Malayerba, the
presence of exile as life experience and creative motif, their constant
investigation of theater theory and practices, their development of a
distinctive dramaturgy of the actor, the playwright and the director, as
well as the collaborative processes of artistic creation with local and
international artists. Renowned plays by the group, like ‘La Fanesca,’
‘Jardín de Pulpos,’ ‘Pluma y la tempestad,’ ‘Nuestra Señora de

usados,’ and ‘Donde el viento hace buñuelos’ are featured in this
video, commented on by Francés and Vargas and contextualized in the bigger
picture of the outstanding theater work by Ecuador’s most important
theater group. The Grupo de Teatro Malayerba (teatromalayerba.org) was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 25 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal ‘Hoja de Teatro,’ conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. The group also runs a theater house, the Casa Malayerba, which houses the Laboratory as well as a theater with seating capacity for seventy people. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes. In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

520 bb $a ‘Malayerba: 25 años de teatro’ is a documentary prepared by 
this
Ecuadorian theater ensemble as an overview of the first 25 years 
of
artistic trajectory. Weaving interviews with founding members and 
artistic
directors María del Rosario ‘Charo’ Francés and Arístides 
Vargas,
and illustrated through video and photo documentation, the documentary
portrays the history and creative coordinates of the Grupo Malayerba, 
the
presence of exile as life experience and creative motif, their 
constant
investigation of theater theory and practices, their development of 
a
distinctive dramaturgy of the actor, the playwright and the director, 
as
well as the collaborative processes of artistic creation with local 
and
international artists. Renowned plays by the group, like ‘La 
Fanesca,’
‘Jardín de Pulpos,’ ‘Pluma y la tempestad,’ ‘Nuestra Señora 
de

520 bb $a ‘Historia de una utopía’ documents the first 16 years of theater work
by Argentinean community theater ensemble Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur.
Told in the words of the group itself (with an array testimonies by diverse
group members), and illustrated with extensive video and photo
documentation, this video maps out the origins and philosophy of the
Catalinas Sur, while showcasing the variety of outdoor and indoor theater
projects they have embarked on since 1983 -from ‘Las Comediantes,’
performed in Plaza Malvinas in 1983, to ‘El Fulgor Argentino,’ here
shown at the group’s own Galpón in 1999. The idea of Grupo de Teatro
Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood
barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the
time of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular
expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of
resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The
group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its
membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse.
Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional
artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of
the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from
the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a
crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed
by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than
20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300
actors. In their own words, ‘with the advent of this globalized and
inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember
the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory
that believed and believes in a better world.’

award in 1998) is a circus operetta performed by the community theater
group Catalinas Sur from the La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The
Japanese Park was an amusement park that welcomed migrants on their arrival
in Argentina. The piece is less a historical recreation than an
affectionate tribute to the popular artists and characters of the ‘circo
criollo’ (like Pepino del 88), film (like King Kong) and television (like
wrestler El Hombre de la Barra de Hielo), who, with their itinerant arts,
brightened up the lives of La Boca’s parents, grandparents, great

520 bb $a 1998 version of the by now traditional murga ‘La Catalina del
Riachuelo,' performed by the community theater group Catalinas Sur of the
La Boca neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Staged since 1992 and
adapted to each year’s sociopolitical climate, the piece poses a
carnivalesque critique of current local political events and social issues.
La Catalina del Riachuelo’s songs, storytelling and humorous skits
compose a satirical commentary on politics and politicians, power and the
powerful, and events of national (and international) repercussion.
Political corruption, police brutality, environmental pollution, and
unemployment are some of the topics discussed in the piece, presented as
the downside of globalization and ‘Progress.' Historically, carnival
–and the local tradition of the Rioplatense ‘murga’- has been a space
for the transgression and critique of the rules of the leading classes by
the popular imaginary. ‘La Catalina del Riachuelo’ is conceived as a
tribute to this Argentinean popular tradition. It is a both a critique of
society’s political maladies and a celebration of hope, love and the
honoring of cultural heritage as social antidotes to these problems, as
cohesive forces giving a sense of community to the inhabitants of La
Boca. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, ‘with the advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better world.’

520 bb $a ‘O sos o no sos’ is Catalinas Sur’s second puppet theater show, a
beautiful spectacle for all ages following their first puppetry piece ‘La
Niña de la Noche.' It is a free adaptation of Frank Tashlin’s story
‘The Bear that Wasn’t.' The piece tells the adventures and exploits
of a bear that wakes up from his winter hibernation to find an industrial
complex where his cave used to be. The bear then gets confused by the
factory foreman as a human worker and is told to work; each of his
successive bosses tries to convince him that he is just a ‘silly man.'
Throughout the play, the bear tries to protect his very identity while
trying to survive in a confusing, threatening world to which he does not
belong. Music, color, masks, a beautiful set and a delightful soundtrack,
along with 22 puppeteers-performers under the direction of Ximena Bianchi,
give life to 35 puppets in order to recreate the story of a bear lost in a
world of men, a struggle for the preservation of identity against all
odds. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983.

520 bb $a ‘El Fulgor Argentino, Club Social y Deportivo’ brings together a
hundred performers, an orchestra and big puppets in order to perform a
hundred years of Argentine history (1930-2030) as seen through the social
dances of a community club. El Fulgor Argentino social club opens its doors
as a dance hall in 1930. The military coup that brings down the presidency
of Hipólito Yrigoyen interrupts the party. From then on, the dance hall
activities reflect the ups and downs in Argentinean history. Political
confrontations and military coups cut short El Fulgor’s dance party, a
celebration permanently struggling to be resumed. Rhythms change, fashion
trends change, the dance is interrupted and reopened, to the beat of
history’s ebbs and flows. This piece is, in Catalinas Sur’s own words,
an exploration of memory, not as a scientific or academic approach to
historical events, but as an artistic attempt to recover and recreate
milestones of the community’s collective memory. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding.

of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and 
the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that 
strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains 
rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has 
grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are 
acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the 
quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, 
musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin 
America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood. Firm 
believers that society can be changed by teamwork and a sense of community, 
Catalinas Sur has created more than 20 plays and, sweeping aside all false 
generation gaps, has now over 300 actors. In their own words, ‘with the 
advent of this globalized and inhumane millennium, we are attempting, through 
the theater, to remember the value of our individual and collective histories, 
and revive the memory that believed and believes in a better 
world.’

520 bb $a ‘El Apagón/The Blackout’ is a bilingual theatrical adaptation of the
story 'La noche que volvimos a ser gente' by José Luis González, set to the sounds of popular Latin songs from
the 1950s and 1960s. Riding the subway uptown towards El Barrio, and eager
to witness the birth of his firstborn, a Puerto Rican man and his best
friend face the Northeast Blackout of 1965. A paean to the courage, humor,
and humanity of migrant experience, the show has been hailed by critics as
‘the quintessential Boricua play.’ 'El Apagón' has been performed
throughout the United States, and in Puerto Rico, Slovakia, and Holland. This video
was taped in April 2007 at Pregones Theater on Walton Avenue in The Bronx,
in celebration of the show’s 15th anniversary; the performance was
premiered at Pregones @ St. Ann’s in the Spring of 1992. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries.

Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company’s repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

520 bb $a 'The Red Rose' narrates the meeting of Puerto Rican activist writer Jesús
Colón and undercover FBI agent Mildred Blauvelt, and their subsequent 
face-off before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1959.
Blauvelt had gone undercover for seven years in the Brooklyn cell of the
Communist Party, where she was simply known as comrade Sylvia. Arriving to
New York in the winter of 1917, Colón went on to become the distinguished
chronicler of the Puerto Rican migrant experience, and one of its enduring
contemporary icons. The aesthetic focus of 'The Red Rose' is on the
physicality of a work that eschews realistic conventions without doing away
with a central narrative thread. Movement, gesture, and dialogue develop in
tandem. It combines literary and popular sources, HUAC transcripts and
recordings, Colón’s private letters, his published articles and stories,
press coverage of the Blauvelt episode, and a treasure trove of songs. The
production was premiered on November 14, 2005 at Pregones Theater, The
Bronx, New York. The sold-out premiere run in 2005-2006 featured
international recording artist Danny Rivera. The production won multiple
HOLA and ACE Awards including Outstanding Musical and Direction. The
original cast recording CD was independently released in March 2006. The
production also had a special run at the newly renovated Teatro de la
Universidad in Puerto Rico and at the 2007 NY Latino International Theater
Festival. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries.

520 bb $a 'El bolero fue mi ruina' ('The Bolero Was My Downfall') is an acclaimed
adaptation of Manuel Ramos Otero’s 'Loca la de la locura.' The play’s
protagonist is an aging transvestite fulfilling the last days of a long
prison sentence for murder. The production deploys the aesthetics of torch
song and kitsch to convey a subtler message about love, abuse, and the
relationship between perpetrator and victim. Since its premiere in 1997, 'El
bolero' has been performed throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico, Peru,
Mexico, and France. New sets and costumes were introduced for the Spring
2006 run at the New Pregones Theater. The performance is dedicated to all
who continue to devote their life to advancing the struggles for equality,
inclusion and justice, and most significantly, to the legacy of Silvia
Rivera – a true crusader and pioneer of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender civil rights movement in the US. Silvia was one of a group of
drag queens who fought police during a raid on the Stonewall Inn on
Christopher Street in 1969, an event that sparked the gay rights movement
in NYC. She died on February 19, 2002, of liver cancer, at the age of
50. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor’s Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility. The ensemble draws from popular Puerto Rican artistic expressions and literature to create and stage its work. Today, Pregones has grown to be one of the leading Puerto Rican/Latino theater theaters in the United States. From migrations to indigenous mythologies to subway stories, the company’s repertoire covers a growing sample of Latino experiences and identities.

520 bb $a Mapa Teatro’s installation project, 'Re-corridos,' memorializes the
demolition of an urban neighborhood known as Santa Inés-El Cartucho in
Bogotá, Colombia. Staged in a rustic, colonial home typical of the neighborhood, the
installation was visited by more than 6,000 spectators during the last
phase of demolition in the first half of December 2003. Based on testimony
of former inhabitants, Mapa Teatro attempts to reconstruct traces of life
in found objects, photographs, sound and audio-visual display as a refuge
for these fragments of memory. The installation consists of 12 physical
spaces that correspond to niches of memory of El Cartucho: 'El Testigo'
(object);  'El campanero' (interactive sound);  'El escombro' (video sound
installation); 'Los pasos' (photographic projection); 'El Carro / La báscula'
(interactive installation);  'La botella' (interactive object);  'La casa'
(video projection);  'La habitación' (video-sound installation);  'La piel'
(sound installation);  'El fósforo' (photo installation);  'El resto'
(installation); 'La voz' (sound installation). One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

520 bb $a This 'radiophonic' play explores the relationship between three people,
their desires, sense of loss and isolation. The play unravels as a journey
of a man passing through a city, a journey of thoughts and words passing
inside the man's head, the passing of a story that ebbs and flows, of
history repeating itself, of sense lost and recovered. Voices, in their
continuous expression and circulation, turn into the face of history and
story, their sound turned fractured gestures. And both faces and gestures
get shaped in the solitude of those who listen.The production is configured
as a digital voice soundscape with a one-shot, aerial-view video of a
billiard table in play (featuring international champion billiard player
Jaime Bedoya). Streams of sound, words and disembodied voices evoke
repetitions and pulses between memory, affect and influence, murmuring
softly of a broken long term love affair, of war, intrigue and
exile. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984.

520 bb $a Mapa Teatro's piece '4.48 Psicosis,' based on Sarah Kane's posthumous play,
references that time at dawn where psychotic crisis episodes present
themselves. The text is not a product of depression but a dramatic poem
where words are decanted by disillusionment, a solo symphony at 4:48 am,
the happy hour when clarity pays a visit. In this production, the voice
-along with music and fragmented images- is configured in space as a poetic
sound installation. Three voices are present: that of a fragmented mind,
that of a woman in love with absence, and the soft psychiatric voice of
reason. The resulting performance is not a representation or a description
of Kane's texts, but a series of photograms portraying the journey of a
woman pierced by visions of a dehumanized world.

Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and 
art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi 
Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, 
mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes 
richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex 
psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to 
experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ 
they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that 
offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and 
performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with 
highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and 
(re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as 
the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that 
explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro 
has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects 
world-wide.

Experimentale des Theatres and Anatoli Vassiliev to stage Bernard Marie
Koltès' 'Quai Ouest' with Russian actors in the framework of the World
Olympics of Theater celebrated in Moscow. The following year, he staged
another version in Bogotá. 'Muelle Oeste' tells the story of a random
meeting of eight dispossessed people in a warehouse on a pier in a major
Western port city (Koltès was inspired by a visit to New York City). Each
one of the characters in this underworld is, in their own eyes, subjected
to the trading of their needs and desires, holding on to the tatters of
their civilized ways. In this production, the architectonic richness of the
Teatro Colón in Bogotá provides the conditions of possibility to
represent, spatially, each of the eight points of views at play in 'Muelle
Oeste' --eight worldviews from eight characters who, uprooted from their
homelands, their communities and their ways of life, will negotiate with
whatever they got left in order to fulfill their unavoidable
fate. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984.

520 bb $a Video documentation Mapa Teatro's production of Heiner Müller's 'Horacio,'
created with prison inmates of La Picota central penitentiary in Bogotá. 
This video includes takes form the rehearsal process with the prisoners at
La Picota. Rehearsal was interrupted by authorities that peacefully
requested that the group leave the stage location. Camera follows the group
of actors and the director onto the street appearing to be unintentionally
recording the activities with few prolonged and established shots. The
camera obscurely captures this live occurrance of their removal and new
found location in a prison yard policed by armed men --friendly banter
between the actors and police, large vehicles move in and out of the yard,
footage of chained barred fence with groups of uniformed and armed police
milling about on both sides as actors board a bus that pulls up inside the
yard. Camera follows the group of actors and director from the prison yard
by bus to the Camarín del Carmen theater and through pre-show warm-ups,
ensemble and personal interviews with the actors. The production is staged
in the context of the International Human Rights Day. The play begins 3/4
through the tape. Under a large spotlight on a sparse stage with rope, wire
and flowers hanging from the ceiling, the play experiments with the
representation of an enclosed space. The project demonstrates the work of
the actors' imagination of both mental and physical space as they enact
their role through movements, gestures and the manipulation of objects. The
video ends approximately 15 minutes into the performance. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

520 bb $a The story of 'Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes' by renowned
Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez is here staged in the traditional
art of Theru Koothu of Southern India as a collaboration between two theater
companies, Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Theru Kothu Manram of Tamil
Nadu, and Mapa Teatro of Bogotá, Colombia. The story metaphorically
unravels as an intercultural, theatrical and human experience: a man from
another world appears one day, fallen from the sky into the backyard of
Pelayo, a villager, and his wife, Elisenda. The production is, for both
companies, an experience of alterity and difference, where an experimental
theater from the 'new continent' searches in the traditions of popular
theater from the 'thousand-year-old continent,' looking for thriving
ritual forms and a 'total language' capable of illuminating the dark paths
of contemporary theater, while the ancient epic art of Theru Koothu
discovers in the works of a contemporary playwright and in the gaze of Mapa
Teatro's theater the possibility to explore new horizons and revitalize its
own tradition. According to Mapa Teatro, the experience revealed 'a
post-dramatic theatrical form approaching pre-dramatic forms and
vice-versa, creating a dialogue between past and present over the space of
the performance itself.’ Approx. first 20 min. of this video
documentation is dedicated to backstage pre-performance activities
following various actors through parts of their preparation routine in
drinking coffee, applying make-up and sitting about a large room together.
A brief interview with Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro
contextualizes their working relationships, while actors sit behind them
applying make-up to their faces and skin in the background. The video
concludes with two fragments of the performance recorded by two different
cameras. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation.

production features Colombian mezzo-soprano Martha Senn as Medea, along
with a chamber ensemble formed by members of the Philharmonic Orchestra of
Bogotá. Constructed out of huge sheets of wrapped cloth, the figure of
Medea towers over her subjects and creators in a classic and surrealistic
representation of tragedy, magic and myth. After the documentation of the
performance, this video includes close-up shots of the diverse characters,
showing details of their make-up, their costumes, and the stage. The
aesthetic and visual achievement of this production, as well as its
showcase of Colombian musical talent, brought considerable recognition to

Mortibus, Réquiem para Beckett.' Between 1988 and 1990, Heidi and Rolf
Abderhalden embarked on an in-depth research process on the literary works
of Samuel Beckett. Three months before his death, Beckett gave his approval
for the production, which premiered in Bogotá in 1990 to critical acclaim.
In 'De Mortibus', the walls are painted white, actors are dressed in gray
and nobody speaks as if it were a world of paralysis. Actors work in almost
total silence, forming sculptures and finally recognizable emotional states
such as sadness, rage, indifference, uncertainty. Mapa Teatro’s project
assigns each gesture, object, color, position, sound and word a specific
intention: to communicate and produce sensations, to invite a reaction or
some provoked experience by which the limits of communication are
(re)established. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation.

Breaking Yokasta into multiple characters enabled Schechner and Stanescu to reconfigure the story as a plural narrative of conflicting desires and life experiences. The multi-faceted work combines irony, tragedy, humor, sexuality, murder, and pop culture. Yoyo,  a prepubescent girl is determined and hopeful as she insists she will not live the life fated for her. Yoko, is first seen on the night she abandons Oedipus and last seen on the night before Laius leaves for his last journey to Delphi. Bitter and angry, Yoko seeks vengeance for her ruined life. Yono welcomes youthful, lusty Oedipus back to Thebes, marries him, bears four children, and trains him to be king. She also describes how, before Oedipus re-entered her life, she drowned her boy newborns. Finally, Yokasta, around 55, a sage and sharp-witted cynic, tours talk shows to denounce the ‘lies’ that Sophocles and Freud wrote about her. Laius-Oedipus-Talk Show Host is foil, partner, lover, son, and father. In one talk show scene the Yokastas, representing Yokasta, Medea, and Phaedra, argue over who is ‘tragedy’s baddest mama.’ The multiple Yokastas share the stage interacting and disagreeing with each other and, finally, with the audience. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theatre, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.'

520 bb $a Rather than lock Chekhov's ‘Three Sisters’ into its own or any other single period, the production moves through time. The first act, performed realistically, takes place in 1901 in a provincial Russian town. The action centers around the 22nd birthday party of Irina, the youngest sister and the arrival in town of the handsome officer, Colonel Vershinin. The second act is staged in biomechanical style, as the Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold might have done in the early 1920s, the high point of Soviet revolutionary aspirations. The stage is bare except for two benches, a couch, and a piano. The actors sing Red Army songs. The third act takes place in the 1950s in a Siberian labor camp. The prisoners enact Chekhov’s play as they build walls of cinder blocks. The last act takes place in the here and now of the theater. The performers, speaking through microphones, address the audience directly. In the background, fragments of dialogue from the previous acts are spoken in an undertone. The sisters’ dream of returning to Moscow has been shattered; the love affairs have ended. As the sisters wonder what their suffering means, the old doctor Chebutykin mutters, ‘It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.’ Though performed mostly in English, Chekhov's Russian text is also heard as the role of Anfisa is played entirely in that language by Michele Minnick who translated the play from Russian. The cast also performs a number of East European songs from the 19th and 20th centuries. In this production, East Coast Artists test and explore the relevance of ‘Three Sisters’ as drama, physical theater, fear and hope in desperate times, farce, and soap-opera.

520 bb $a Rather than lock Chekhov's ‘Three Sisters’ into its own or any 
other single period, the production moves through time. The first act, 
performed realistically, takes place in 1901 in a provincial Russian town. The 
action centers around the 22nd birthday party of Irina, the youngest sister and 
the arrival in town of the handsome officer, Colonel Vershinin. The second act 
is staged in biomechanical style, as the Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold 
might have done in the early 1920s, the high point of Soviet revolutionary 
aspirations. The stage is bare except for two benches, a couch, and a piano. 
The actors sing Red Army songs. The third act takes place in the 1950s in a 
Siberian labor camp. The prisoners enact Chekhov’s play as they build walls 
of cinder blocks. The last act takes place in the here and now of the theater. 
The performers, speaking through microphones, address the audience directly. In 
the background, fragments of dialogue from the previous acts are spoken in an 
undertone. The sisters’ dream of returning to Moscow has been shattered; the 
love affairs have ended. As the sisters wonder what their suffering means, the 
old doctor Chebutykin mutters, ‘It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.’

520 bb $a ‘Dionysus in 69’ is the first performance of The Performance Group that emerged in 1968 from a workshop led by Richard Schechner in November 1967 shortly after he arrived from Tulane University to teach at NYU. ‘D69’ was the first environmental theater production shown at the Performing Garage, the long-time home of TPG and later, the Wooster Group that emerged in 1980 from TPG. A free-wheeling adaptation and distortion of Euripides ‘The Bacchae D69’ is notable for the combination of a number of ‘firsts’ for the New York theater, including audience participation, man-to-man kissing, and full-frontal nudity of both women and men.  The Performing Garage was filled with platforms and towers, the floor covered with carpets. There were no seats which meant that performers and spectators shared the space, sitting on the floor or perched on scaffolds. ‘D69’ was created during a long period of workshops and rehearsals. The production – like all of Schechner’s work that followed – was never finished. Before each performance, Schechner gave extensive notes and made many revisions. Over the 14-month run, the roles were rotated among the cast, including a woman playing the god Dionysus (Joan MacIntosh). The Performance Group used their performances as a means of confronting the psychic, physical, social, and political work of the performer and the spectator. The film was made by De Palma and his colleagues from footage shot during two in June and July, 1968. The film uses two screen images shown simultaneously to give some feel of the totally inclusive environmental theater technique pioneered by Schechner. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice.

520 bb $a All three plays of ‘The Oresteia’ in one 3-hour performance were staged in a converted bandshell in the Da’An Forest Park at the center of Taipei. The bandshell was completely made over into a circular orchestra and skene. More than 2,500 spectators sat on the hillside. Some of the action took place among them – for example, Agamemnon makes his triumphal entry after the victory at Troy by being pulled in a chariot across the crest of the hill through the crowds of spectators. The doomed warrior-king, greeted by his regal wife Clytemnestra, steps onto a 75’ long strip of purple cloth. As Agamemnon disappears into the palace, Cassandra, in the back of the chariot howls her despairing prophecy. In the second act, ‘The Libation Bearers,’ Orestes arrives at his father’s tomb, set far up on the hillside. During the third act, ‘The Eumenides,’ the Furies pursue Orestes through the audience. The production is in jingju (classical ‘Beijing Opera’) with its distinct singing styles (accompanied by a full Chinese orchestra), costumes, and staging. But there are also surprising interruptions of post-modernity. The leading performers – Wu Hsing-kuo and Wei Hai-min are Taiwan’s leading classical Chinese actors. The play is performed in Mandarin with portions in older kinds of Chinese particular to jingju. There are some lines in Taiwanese as a character in modern dress explains the story to the Taiwanese-speaking audience.

520 bb $a This film documents and to some degree rearranges the scenes of TPG’s production. In ‘The Tooth of Crime’ Shepard  draws on popular/mythic figures and motifs of the American imaginary such as the cowboy, the rock star, the girl friend, the disc-jockey, and the drifter-outsider. The language of the play is rhythmic with a richness of alliteration and syncopation that The Performance Group actors further embroidered through their verbophysical techniques to produce harmonies, tensions, and emotional and physical states. The drama embodies the contradictions inherent in a star system that creates ‘personalities’ only to discard them when they are no longer commercially productive. Using their own version of rock music, TPG explores in a complex physical environment a world of gangsters and urban cowboys. The performance presents a myriad of comic book characters that underscore the deceptions and failures of the ‘American Dream.’ The subtleties of the characterization, environmental theater mise-en-scene, music, and movement make this production unique. Because the environment makes viewing all of the action from one place impossible, spectators flow with the action from one part of the theater to another. The performance of Spalding Gray as Hoss is perhaps his best work in the ‘regular’ theater. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

520 bb $a Richard Schechner’s East Coast Artists bring this foundational Western myth forward to the end of the 20th century with Faust as a cook-alchemist. Food preparation and consumption is the ruling metaphor for the destructive appetites of Western expansion culminating in both the Nazi crime of genocide and the post-industrial excesses of globalization and genetic manipulation. Schechner and his colleagues rework the story. Mephistopheles played by a woman dressed as a man but not disguising her ‘actual’ gender is assisted by Hitler, also played by a woman. Part One of ‘Faust/gastronome’ draws heavily on Goethe, tracing Faust’s seduction of Gretchen (aided by Mephistopheles) and his abandoning her to her death. A considerable portion of the dialogue is Goethe’s, performed in German. Part Two Schechner describes as a ‘tragedy of development.’ Here Faust heads the ‘Fist Group’ of corporations involved in genetic engineering and global exploitation. Just before his death and damnation, Faust meets Gretchen who has come to seek him out and help bring him to hell. At one point, Hitler’s architect, Albert Speer, appears on a talk show justifying World War II and the Holocaust. Later, Faust and a neo-Nazi teenage appear on the same show. The set features three sturdy wooden tables used in many configurations to contain the action. On a platform upstage, composer Ralph Denzer leads a small jazz ensemble.

520 bb $a For this East Coast Artists production, Schechner largely used the 1603 First Quarto and character names derived from earlier source texts. Schechner proposes a collision of 21st century American popular culture, Elizabethan poetry, and a medieval Danish story. Using contemporary U.S. idiomatic expressions, ballroom dancing, and pop icons such as Marilyn Monroe (Gertred) and Shirley Temple (Ofelia), ‘Hamlet’ embodies a cyclone of tragedy enacted within the postmodernity of the 21st century. As Schechner writes in his program note, Monroe and others steal the words of Shakespeare’s characters and haunt the play from the future—just as Gertrude, an ancient woman, haunts it from the past. Claudius is both a Viking pirate and a contemporary globalizing marauder, blustering and handsome. Polonius is a talking head, a TV pundit full of shopworn sagacity. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are literally rats, their tails trailing behind them as they do tap routines. Claudius hums Broadway tunes. The ‘Get thee to a nunnery’ scene transforms from a ballroom dance number into a violent encounter. Polonius is in an incestuous relationship with Ofelia who is much too old to wear the clothes she does. When her father is murdered, Ofelia cracks up. Hamlet is angry, lost, an outsider in his own home, ironic, crazy, and determined in his indeterminacy.

520 bb $a The video tape begins with people arriving and mingling during a reception held in the Dean’s Conference room at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Thirty to 50 people gather and talk in small groups while the camera moves among them, recording parts of their conversations. Michele Minnick, a member of the ECA, is host for the event. Soon, people find chairs arranged around a large rectangular grid of boxes made of tape on the floor: the rasaboxes. Richard Schechner announces the beginning of the event and suggests that the audience consider the work of ECA as a ‘rethinking the arts.’ He discusses the rasaboxes work as a way for performers to express emotions immediately, without forethought or emotional recall – or any other standard actors’ exercises. Paula Murray Cole explains the grid on the floor – the outline of the nine rasas. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach to enacting the eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theater manual, Bharata’s ‘Natyasastra.’ The ninth, the center box, is left blank because it represents ‘shanta,’ the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud’s call for the actor to be ‘an athlete of the emotions.’ The eight, or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear, horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion), raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss). Workshop participants move within the boxes, jumping from one emotional state to the other and at times engaging interactively. Then ECA members demonstrate the rasaboxes technique. Several speakers, including Richard Schechner describe the RasaBoxes technique and its usefulness in a variety of contexts.

Michele Minnick and Paula Murray Cole lead the workshop in a yoga warmup, intensive breathing and vocal exercises, slow-motion and other exercises invented or adapted by Schechner, and finally the rasaboxes. Taken as a whole, the workshop is an exploration of psycho-physical embodiments connecting the personal to the social. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach that begins with finding a particular form for the eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theatre manual, Bharata’s ‘Natyasastra.’ In the workshop documented in the film, four student participants along with the instructors commence with a warm up and then draw words and pictures in each of eight connected rectangular boxes mapped out on the floor with masking tape. The ninth, the center box, is left blank because it represents ‘shanta,’ the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud’s call for the actor to be ‘an athlete of the emotions.’ The eight, or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear, horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion), raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss).

520 bb $a Based on William Shakespeare’s 'Richard III,' this production explores
and unveils the complex mechanisms of human violence, the abuse of power
and the seed of evil that has historically grown in human societies, with
its own particular local characteristics, but recognizable as a resilient
universal human trait. In times of political conflict, human evil unravels
power plays that had led to violence and genocide, all enacted in cold
blood. Mapa Teatro stages their version of the classic Shakespearean play,
in an attempt to confront and question the spirit of war and violence in
their native Colombia. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.
