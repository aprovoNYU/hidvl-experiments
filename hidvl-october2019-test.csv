By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore,situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's mostcompelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva'(collective creation), addressing the acute social and political problemsof their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation ofCorporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number oftheoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods andlanguages.
