SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

Video documentation Mapa Teatro's production of Heiner Müller's "Horacio," created with prison inmates of La Picota central penitentiary in Bogotá.  This video includes takes form the rehearsal process with the prisoners at La Picota. Rehearsal was interrupted by authorities that peacefully requested that the group leave the stage location. Camera follows the group of actors and the director onto the street appearing to be unintentionally recording the activities with few prolonged and established shots. The camera obscurely captures this live occurrence of their removal and new found location in a prison yard policed by armed men --friendly banter between the actors and police, large vehicles move in and out of the yard, footage of chained barred fence with groups of uniformed and armed police milling about on both sides as actors board a bus that pulls up inside the yard. Camera follows the group of actors and director from the prison yard by bus to the Camarín del Carmen theater and through pre-show warm-ups, ensemble and personal interviews with the actors. The production is staged in the context of the International Human Rights Day. The play begins 3/4 through the tape. Under a large spotlight on a sparse stage with rope, wire and flowers hanging from the ceiling, the play experiments with the representation of an enclosed space. The project demonstrates the work of the actors' imagination of both mental and physical space as they enact their role through movements, gestures and the manipulation of objects. The video ends approximately 15 minutes into the performance. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org <http://www.mapateatro.org> ) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    The story of 'Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes' by renowned Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez is here staged in the traditional art of Theru Koothu of Southern India as a collaboration between two companies, Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Theru Kothu Manram of Tamil Nadu, and Mapa Teatro of Bogotá, Colombia. The story metaphorically unravels as an intercultural, theatrical and human experience: a man from another world appears one day, fallen from the sky into the backyard of Pelayo, a villager and his wife, Elisenda. The production is, for both
companies, an experience of alterity and difference, where an experimental theater from the 'new continent' searches in the traditions of popular theater from the 'thousand-year-old continent,' looking for thriving ritual forms and a 'total language' capable of illuminating the dark paths of contemporary theater, while the ancient epic art of Theru Koothu discovers, in the work of a contemporary playwright and in the gaze of Mapa Teatro's theater, the possibility of exploring new horizons and revitalizing its own tradition. According to Mapa Teatro, the experience revealed 'a post-dramatic theatrical form approaching pre-dramatic forms and vice-versa, creating a dialogue between past and present over the space of the performance itself.' Approx. first 20 min. of this video documentation is dedicated to backstage pre-performance activities, following various actors through parts of their preparation routine in drinking coffee, applying make-up and sitting about a large room together. A brief interview with Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro contextualizes their working relationship, while actors sit behind them applying make-up in the background. The video concludes with two fragments of the performance recorded by two different cameras.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Heiner Müller's 'Medea Material,' the first
production of the Mapa Teatro's 'Müller cycle.' This musical theater
production features Colombian mezzo-soprano Martha Senn as Medea, along with a chamber ensemble formed by members of the Philarmonic Orchestra of Bogotá. Constructed out of huge sheets of wrapped cloth, the figure of Medea towers over her subjects and creators in a classic and surrealistic representation of tragedy, magic and myth. After the documentation of the performance, this video includes close-up shots of the diverse characters, showing details of their make-up, their costumes, and the stage. The aesthetic and visual achievement of this production, as well as its showcase of Colombian musical talent, brought considerable recognition to Mapa Teatro in the first decade of its artistic development. One of the
foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro  (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and
(re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of a fragment of Mapa Teatro's production 'De
Mortibus, Réquiem para Beckett.' Between 1988 and 1990, Heidi and Rolf
Abderhalden embarked on an in-depth research process on the literary works
of Samuel Beckett. Three months before his death, Beckett gave his approval
for this production, which premiered in Bogotá in 1990 to critical acclaim.
In 'De Mortibus,' the walls are painted white, actors are dressed in gray
and nobody speaks --as if it were a world of paralysis. Actors work in almost
total silence, forming sculptures that embody emotional states
such as sadness, rage, indifference, and uncertainty. Mapa Teatro's production
assigns each gesture, object, color, position, sound, and word a specific
intention: to communicate and produce sensations, to invite a reaction, and
to provoke an experience by which the limits of communication are
(re)established. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa
Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art
installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi
Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera,
mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work
proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often
complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to
experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of
fiction,' they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social
imagination,' that offers a space for presenting community issues and human
concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations
and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension
between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live
events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in
Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of
postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by
commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Based on William Shakespeare’s 'Richard III,' this production explores and unveils the complex mechanisms of human violence, the abuse of power, and the seed of evil that has historically grown in human societies, with its own particular local characteristics, but recognizable as a resilient universal human trait. In times of political conflict, human evil unravels power plays that had led to violence and genocide, all enacted in cold blood. Mapa Teatro stages their version of the classic Shakespearean play, in an attempt to confront and question the spirit of war and violence in their native Colombia. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance
and art installation projects since 1984.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Interview with Richard Schechner, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on
the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned
figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and
university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds, including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies. His books include 'Environmental
Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology,' 'Performance Studies: An Introduction,' and ‘Over, Under, and Around.’ Currently he is working on two books: ‘Ramlila of Ramnagar’ and ‘After the Avantgarde.’ As of 2008, his books have been translated into 14 languages. Schechner has been a National Endowment for the Humanities senior research fellow, a Smithsonian Institution research fellow, a Fulbright senior research fellow and a Guggenheim fellow, among other honors. He is also renowned for founding The Performance Group, and is currently the artistic director of East Coast Artists. He has directed
plays, lectured, and conducted performance workshops in Asia, South Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Schechner is an honorary professor of the Shanghai Theatre Academy where he leads the Richard Schechner
Center.

Barbara Browning is Associate Professor of Performance Studies at New York
University. She previously chaired the Performance Studies Department. She
received her Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctoral degrees in Comparative
Literature from Yale University. In 1983 she was awarded a Fulbright
fellowship for the study of popular literature in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
Also trained as a dancer, Dr. Browning published her first book, Samba:
Resistance in Motion, winner of the de la Torre Bueno Prize for an
outstanding work of dance scholarship, in 1995. She went on to write
Infectious Rhythm: Metaphors of Contagion and the Spread of African
Culture, which was published in 1998. Her articles have appeared in
anthologies, as well as such publications as Dance Research Journal, TDR,
Dance Chronicle, and Women & Performance. She serves on the boards of
directors of both the Congress of Research on Dance and the Society of
Dance History Scholars. Dr. Browning is also a member of the editorial
board of Women & Performance and the advisory board of DRJ. Her practical
training in Brazilian dance was greatly amplified during her Fulbright year
in Bahia and led to her further study, instruction, and performance of
Brazilian dance in Brazil, the United States, and Europe. She performed for
several years with both the Loremil Machado Afro-Brazilian Dance Company
and Silvana Magda's Viva Bahia. While no longer performing professionally,
she continues to merge practical engagement of body practices with her
scholarly work, which broadly addresses performance and politics in the
African diaspora.

the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a

abroad, and has published reviews and essays in Social Text, Theatre
Journal, GLQ, TDR, and Women and Performance. His forthcoming book, The
Amalgamation Waltz: Antebellum Genealogies of the Hybrid Future,

half of the nineteenth century staged fears and anticipations of a racially
hybrid nation to come. Major Interests include performance in the black
diaspora, cultural studies, queer and feminist theory, the nineteenth-century,
history and memory.

outrageous stories of everyday lesbian life, touching off controversy and
challenging complacency at every turn. Her combination of poetic imagery
and political satire has earned her wide attention and placed her work at
the center of America's culture wars. Hughes is Associate Professor of the
School of Art & Design and the Department of Theatre and Drama at the
University of Michigan and an activist for lesbian issues. She is the
recipient of two Village Voice Obie awards, a Lambda Book Award, a GLAAD
media award, and a Distinguished Alumni Award. Hughes has performed at
venues across North America, Great Britain and Australia. She has published
two books: Clit Notes: A Sapphic Sampler; and O Solo Homo: The New Queer
Performance, co-edited with Dr. David Roman. In addition, her work has been
widely anthologized and has served as foundational material for performance
studies, queer studies and feminist performance studies. Hughes is
currently co-editing, with Alina Troyano, 'Memories of the Revolution,' an
anthology of scripts, interviews and photographs from the first ten years
of the New York City’s Wow Café.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Interview with Joseph Roach, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director
of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is
a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around
the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a
multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the
coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through
which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The
contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the
groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures
in contemporary performance studies and practice. Joseph Roach is Sterling
Professor of Theatre and Professor of English and African American Studies
at Yale University. Dr. Roach has chaired the Department of Performing Arts
at Washington University in St. Louis, the Interdisciplinary PhD in Theatre
at Northwestern University, and the Department of Performance Studies at
NYU. He has served as Director of Graduate Studies in English and Chair of
the Theater Studies Advisory Committee at Yale. His most recent book is It
(2007), a study of charismatic celebrity. His other books and articles
include Cities of the Dead: Circum-Atlantic Performance (1996), The
Player's Passion: Studies in the Science of Acting (1993), and essays in
Theatre Journal, Theatre Survey, The Drama Review, Theatre History Studies,
Discourse, Theater, Text and Performance Quarterly, and others. Roach holds
a B.A. from the University of Kansas, an M.A. from the University of
Newcastle upon Tyne and a Ph.D. from Cornell University. Roach's many
honors include a Senior Fellowship from the National Endowment for the
Humanities and a Lifetime Distinguished Scholar Award from the American
Society for Theatre Research. In 2006, he won a Distinguished Achievement
Award from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to create Yale's research
program in 'World Performance'” A foremost theater historian and pioneer
in the development of performance studies methods and research, his
research negotiates the Circum-Atlantic, the threshold between life and
death, the relationships between religion, ritual, performance, and daily
life, and the way in which history 'isn't over yet.'

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Interview with Patrick Anderson, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia,
associate director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric
Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?'
The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult
task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well
as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and
embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are
based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of
renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice. Patrick
Anderson is Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at the
University of California, San Diego, where he is also affiliated with the
Critical Gender Studies Program and the Ethnic Studies Department. Anderson
graduated from the School of Communication of Northwestern University with
a double major in Performance Studies and Anthropology, received a
Fulbright Fellowship to conduct research on ritual performance in Sri
Lanka, earned an M.A. in Cultural Studies/Communication Studies at the
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and a Ph.D. in Performance
Studies (with a designated emphasis in women, gender, and sexuality) at the
University of California-Berkeley. His background includes training and
experience in theater and dance, film, cultural studies, queer and gender
studies, ethnic studies, political geography, psychoanalysis, and
anthropology. Bridging the fields of performance studies and cultural
studies, Anderson's work explores enactments of violence and productions of
political subjectivity within institutional domains including the prison,
the clinic, the gallery, and the theater. His first book, So Much Wasted
(currently in revision), explores hunger striking, anorexia nervosa, and
staged fasts as spectacular, radically charged practices that attempt to
intervene in ideological state sovereignty. His second book, Violence
Performed, a collection of essays co-edited with Jisha Menon, interrogates
violence as performance and performative in contemporary global politics.
His next project, Against Empathy, argues for a radical re-thinking of how
and why empathy underwrites both performance practice and multiculturalist
discourse in contemporary American cultural politics.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Interview with Ileana Diéguez, conducted by Mila Aponte-González, during
the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics,
held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia under the title 'Staging
Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought
together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies,
memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. In this interview,
Ileana Diéguez talks about her take on how her particular performance-related
work makes a political intervention in the public sphere. Her book
Escenarios liminales (Liminal Stages/Scenarios) is one of the most
important publications in Latin America addressing the region's performance
practices of recent years. Diéguez’s work discusses theatre and
performance art in Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, analyzing
performances that not only break with stage conventions, but that point to
new ways of engaging politics.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Interview with Santiago García, conducted by Mila Aponte-González, during the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' In this interview, Santiago García talks about his take on how his particular performance-related work makes a political intervention in the public sphere. This interview complements Teatro La Candelaria's performance 'A título personal,' showcased in this 10-day event, which brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Directed by Santiago García, Teatro La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals. Engaged in an ongoing exploration of national folklore, events, and characters, much of their repertoire was created using the 'collective creation' method.  La Candelaria also fostered the creation of the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro and has developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of  Jesús Martín Barbero’s keynote address,
‘Artes de la memoria y regímenes de visibilidad,’ presented as a part
of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Introduced by
Marcial Godoy-Anativia, Jesús Martín Barbero’s discussion addresses the
fundamental issue still pending in Colombia – the very special
relationship between politics and violence in the fabric of its memories
and history. In Colombia, an increasingly broad and dense imagination/social
creativity is revealing itself in the strategies of physical and cultural
survival practiced by millions of citizens, as well as in the new visual
art created by women and the audiovisual and literary narratives of young
people, allowing us to see the political magnitude of their arts. Jesús
Martín Barbero is a semiologist, anthropologist and philosopher.  He is an
expert in communications and media who has produced important theoretical
synthesis around concepts of post-modernity in Latin America.  He is a
member of the Scientific Committee of Infoamerica.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui’s keynote address,
‘Sociología de la imagen: Una visión desde la historia andina,’
presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia,
under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.'
This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around
the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.
With an introduction by Fabio López de la Roche (read by Luisa
Piedrahita), Silvia Rivera Cuscanqui’s keynote offers a reading of
Guamán Poma de Ayala and Melchor María Mercado as theorists of Andean
reality in colonial and republican times. Their images constitute a hidden
text that reveals aspects not directly addressed in their writings.
Building on these reflections, the speaker argues the need to consider
non-alphabetic forms of Andean discourse as a path toward understanding
colonial and postcolonial experience in the Andes. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui
is a Bolivian sociologist and activist of Aymara descent. In 1983 she
joined other indigenous and mestizo intellectuals in founding the Andean
Oral History Workshop, an independent group devoted to issues of orality,
identity, and popular and indigenous social movements, primarily in the
Aymara region.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui’s keynote address,
‘Sociología de la imagen: Una visión desde la historia andina,’
presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia,
under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.'
This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around
the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.
With an introduction by Fabio López de la Roche (read by Luisa
Piedrahita), Silvia Rivera Cuscanqui’s keynote offers a reading of
Guamán Poma de Ayala and Melchor María Mercado as theorists of Andean
reality in colonial and republican times. Their images constitute a hidden
text that reveals aspects not directly addressed in their writings.
Building on these reflections, the speaker argues the need to consider
non-alphabetic forms of Andean discourse as a path toward understanding
colonial and postcolonial experience in the Andes. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui
is a Bolivian sociologist and activist of Aymara descent. In 1983 she
joined other indigenous and mestizo intellectuals in founding the Andean
Oral History Workshop, an independent group devoted to issues of orality,
identity, and popular and indigenous social movements, primarily in the

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. With an introduction by Luz Gabriela Arango, Nelly Richard’s keynote discusses how feminist theory today defines itself as cultural critique, without relinquishing the sociopolitical force of its struggles against gender discrimination. This allows feminism's emancipatory potential to encompass imaginary and symbolic configurations of subjective economies that exceed those categories of 'identity' and 'difference' preconfigured by the sociology of gender. Nelly Richard is a scholar, essayist, and author of numerous books. Richard studied Modern literature at the Université de la Sorbonne (Paris IV) and founded the Revista de Crítica Cultural, serving as its director from 1990 to 2008. She currently chairs the Masters program in Cultural Studies at ARCIS University in Santiago, Chile and is the Provost of Extension, Communications, and Publications of the same university.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Suely Rolnik ‘s keynote address, ‘Furor de
archivo,’ presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá,
Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the
Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and
art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of
citizenship. With an introduction by Francisco Montaña, Suely Rolnik’s
keynote discusses how over the last two decades, a compulsion to archive
has seized a large part of the globalized territory of art. Among the
privileged objects of analysis are Latin American artistic proposals
developed during the 1960s and 70s. What are the politics of desire driving
these initiatives and their modes of presentation? Suely Rolnik Rolnik has
degrees in Sociology and Philosophy from the Université Paris VIII and a
degree in Psychology from the Université Paris VII. Her work is located in
a terrain transversalized by philosophy, clinical practice, politics, and
aesthetics and takes the form of research, writing, teaching, treatment,
and clinical practice strictu senso. She is the author, among other books,
of Micropolítica: Cartografías del deseo (in collaboration with Félix
Guattari).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Mary Louise Pratt’s keynote address, ‘Languaje
Ecology, Language Politics: Towards a Geolinguistic Imagination’,’
presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia,

This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around
the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.
With an introduction by Esther Gabara, Mary Louise Pratt’s keynote asks:
What will the world look like linguistically a hundred years from now? This
lecture discusses some of the processes of linguistic change, including
language death, language migration, and the formation of lingua francas and
interlanguages. It asks the idea of rights in this context and considers
what an ecological approach to language might involve. Mary Louise Pratt is
Silver Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and the
Department of Spanish and Portuguese at New York University, where she
teaches Latin American literature and cultural theory. She has published
extensively on the subjects of Latin American women's writing; travel
literature and imperialism; language and militarization; and modernity and
neoliberalism. She has been affiliated with the Hemispheric Institute since
2002.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Andreas Huyssen’s keynote address, ‘Natural
Rights, Civil Rights, and the Politics of Memory’,’ presented as a part
of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. With an
introduction by María Belén Sáez de Ibarra, Andreas Huyssen’s keynote
proposes that human rights and memory discourses must be robustly linked
with each other to add a necessary dimension of futurity to memory and of
history to human rights politics. This keynote asks to what extent
‘rights of nature’ need to be considered to nurture the sustainability
of human rights as social rights. Andreas Huyssen is Villard Professor of
German and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. He is founding
director of Columbia’s Institute for Comparative Literature and Society
(1998-2003). His books include After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass
Culture, Postmodernism (1986), and Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the
Politics of Memory (2003). He is the editor, most recently, of Other
Cities, Other Worlds: Urban Imaginaries in a Globalizing Age (2008).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    
'The Final Rehearsal' by Peru’s Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, was presented
as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance
and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Set in an old
theater, which was also once a cinema hall, a group of artists crafted a
homage to a legendary diva whose life story parallels the history of
twentieth-century Peru.  Since 1971, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been
working at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political
performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani' is a Quechua word that
means 'I am thinking, I am remembering.' Under this name, the theater group
has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory,
particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in
Peru.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'The Final Rehearsal' by Peru’s Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, was presented
as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance
and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. This edited
version of the performance offers a privileged view of the counterpoint
between the performers' bodies and the media and texts that are present on
stage. Set in an old theater, which was also once a cinema hall, a group of
artists crafted a homage to a legendary diva whose life story parallels the
history of twentieth-century Peru.  Since 1971, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani
has been working at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political
performance, and collective creation. 'Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that
means 'I am thinking, I am remembering.' Under this name, the theater group
has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory,
particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in
Peru.

share their processes of creation with an audience that performs as a
witness of the group's own history. Througout this performance composition
method demonstration, there is an exploration of various stages of this
collective's past performances; in doing this, the performers are
engendering a new moment in the development of the group's proposals. Past,
present, and future converge in the performers's bodies - a corporeality
that mirrors the past and possibilites of Peruvian history, and stages a
rehearsal of the future. Since 1971, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'Transvestite Museum,' by Peruvian researcher and artist Giuseppe
Campuzano, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá,
Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the
Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and
art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of
citizenship.  Since 2003, Campuzano has been working on the 'Transvestite
Museum' project, an exploration of the realities of transvestism, a staging
of its aesthetics, and a confrontation between its forms of knowledge and
official discourses. This performance explored a transvestite body that
performs in order to persist in the face of a denied discourse: ritual
turned into spectacle, a queer body whose performance deconstructs and
assembles its topics and differences as strategy.The 'Transvestite Museum'
appeared at the National University within a geneology of Peruvian ritual
dance, always from the body: the bodies of the Chicas Extraordinarias in
relationship with their intra-university address, and the body of Luis
Gerardo Rosero, weaving together objects and subjects of shared memory
through his choreography.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'Sonata for Pussyphone and Voice, opus 140' was presented by México’s
Rocío Boliver and Ana Luz Álvarez, as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the
Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009
in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights
in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship,
and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers
of citizenship. 'Sonata for Pussyphone and Voice, opus 140' was a concert
in four movements performed by a woman who used a musical instrument called
pussyphone, which is played with the vagina. This performance offered a
reflection on cultural rights for all audiences. At the same time this
performance staged a reflection on the politics of spaces, and the politics
of art as institution - the femenine body was situated at the center of the
National University of Bogota's Music Conservatory. Boliver has been active
in the art world for the past ten years. She began her career as a
performer in 1992 with a reading of her porno-erotic texts, focusing her
critique on the repression of women.  Álvarez Torres is an opera singer,
actress and musician who specializes in jazz.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Comadre Araña’s concert was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of
the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of
2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural
Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism,
scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles,
and frontiers of citizenship.  In Comadre Araña, the traditional music of
Colombia's Pacific region meets jazz, rock, pop and electronic music. Three
female voices intermingle with the rhythm of the bombo, marimba, cununo and
guasá, along with electronic instruments such as the Indian sitar, the
tiple guitar of the Colombian Andes, loops, samplers and all the resources
of live electronic music. This edited version of the concert offers a
privileged view of the musicians and the way they play their instruments -
on stage, Comadre Araña functions as an organic experience where human
voices and bodies intertwine with musical instruments. It members include;
Juan Sebastián Monsalve (Director and bass player), Juanita Delgado
(voice), Verónica Atehortúa (voice), Urpi Barco Quintana (voice), Andrés
Felipe Salazas (drums and percussion), Rocío Medina (marimba de chonta and
percussion), Edwin Ospina (electric guitar, percussion), Camilo Velásquez
(tiple guitar, electronic programming and guitar).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Honor Ford-Smith’s Letters from the Dead was presented as a part of the
7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics,
held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging
Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought
together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies,
memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. 'Letters from the Dead'
began as a collectively-created image event commemorating the murder of
thousands of youth killed in inner city violence in Toronto's Caribbean
diaspora. The event comprised a silent funeral procession in the street.
Bringing together the messages from the dead and media reports on violence,
and the losses of living, the performance traced one woman’s attempt to
bury her grandson and convey his demands for justice in the present.
Ford-Smith is Assistant Professor in Community and Environmental Arts, at
the Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University. She is best known
for her work as the founding Artistic Director of the Sistren Theatre
Collective in Jamaica. Her publications include 3 Jamaican Plays 1976-1986;
Lionheart Gal: Life stories of Jamaican Women (with the Sistren
collective); and My Mother’s Last Dance: An anthology of poems.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Universes presented 'Live form the Edge' as a part of the 7th Encuentro of
the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of
2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural
Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism,

showcased the ensemble’s special brand of fusion theater in a 'best of'
event that tracks the evolution of their poetic language from childhood
rhymes and community rituals to poetry and theater, hip-hop and gospel.
Redefining what theater is and who it speaks to, 'Live from the Edge' was a
unique performance event that turned the poem into a communal act.
Universes is a poetic theater ensemble of multi-disciplined writers and
performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home
blues and Latin American boleros, to create moving, challenging and
entertaining theatrical works. Its members include Steven Sapp, Mildred
Ruiz, Gamal Abdel Chasten and Ninja.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Colombia’s Teatro La Candelaria presented 'In a Personal Capacity' ('A
título personal') as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá,
Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the
Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and
art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of
citizenship.  'In a Personal Capacity' was an experimental work that
explored, through the collective efforts of its members, the field of
information and communications in our contemporary world. At the same time,
the members of the group look inside their own work, in a fragmentary
self-reflection process that releases questions about their role as
artists, as a collective, and as Colombians. Directed by Santiago García,
Teatro La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists
and intellectuals. Engaged in an ongoing exploration of national folklore,
events, and characters, much of their repertoire was created using the
'collective creation' method.  La Candelaria also fostered the creation of
the Corporación Colombiana de Teatro and has developed a number of
theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and
languages.

the members of the group look inside their own work, in a fragmentary
self-reflection process that releases questions about their role as
artists, as a collective, and as Colombians. This edited version of their
performance offers a closer view to their proposal: La Candelaria is a
collective, but a collective formed by individuals, a dynamic that implies
a continous negotiation between personal goals and the necessities of the
collective. Directed by Santiago García, Teatro La Candelaria was founded
in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals. Engaged in an
ongoing exploration of national folklore, events, and characters, much of
their repertoire was created using the 'collective creation' method.  La

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Mexican performer Astrid Hadad presented 'Astrid Hadad’s Bizarre Cabaret'
as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance
and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.  Astrid
Hadad's 'Bizarre Cabaret' was a performance mixed with a batucada, in the
middle of a theatrical scene with a historical cultural background based on
the anthropological sciences of different eras. Hadad's shows consist of
fast-paced, fragmented, parodic unveilings of traditional Mexican song,
dress, dance, and political satire. She incorporates elements from Mexican
visual arts, music, and cinema, along with actions and gestures from
popular culture. Astrid Hadad was born in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico. 
She graduated from the Centro Universitario de Teatro after deserting her
studies in Political and Social Sciences at the Universidad de México.
Hadad uses cabaret and performance to represent social, cultural, and
political crisis in Mexico and, in turn, to entertain.  Since rejecting
institutional support and affiliation early in her career, Hadad has
written, produced, managed, and promoted her own work, establishing
audiences throughout Mexico, the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, and Latin
America, gaining reknown for her shows, Heavy Nopal, La Multimamada, La
Pecadora, Seducida y Abandonada, and Corazon Sangrante. As an accomplished
vocalist, her albums circulate internationally.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    
'Phobophilia, arousal from fear,' by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard of
2boys.tv, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá,
Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the
Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and
art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of
citizenship. In this performance, a small number of spectators are
blindfolded and led to a secret location to witness a peculiar
interrogation. 'Phobophilia' poses the question: What is the role of the
poet in an age characterized by fear? The performance, inspired by the life
and art of Jean Cocteau, explores the relationship between artist and
audience, and the negotiations established upon a sensation of fear that
can be mesmerizing. This negotation also exists within the artistic
practice: the performer's physical body interacts with a video projection
of himself - a miniature that is both vulnerable and powerful. 2boys.tv is
a transdisciplinary duo from Montreal, Canada composed by Stephen Lawson
and Aaron Pollard (also notoriously known in some circles as alter egos
Gigi L’Amour and Pipi Douleur). They have created a wide repertoire of
epic multimedia cabaret works, performances, videos, and installations.

'Phobophilia, arousal from fear,' by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard of
2boys.tv, was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric

Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the
Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and
art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of
citizenship. In this performance, a small number of spectators are
blindfolded and led to a secret location to witness a peculiar
interrogation. 'Phobophilia' poses the question: What is the role of the
poet in an age characterized by fear? This edited version offers additional
material that follows the audience's walk towards the performance - a path
that leads them to the experience of darkness and fear; a path that perhaps
never ends. The performance, inspired by the life and art of Jean Cocteau,
explores the relationship between artist and audience, and the negotiations
established upon a sensation of fear that can be mesmerizing. This
negotation also exists within the artistic practice: the performer's
physical body interacts with a video projection of himself - a miniature

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'Where are they? Living Memory. Women in the Public Square' (¿Dónde
están? Memoria viva. Mujeres en la plaza) was presented as a part of the
7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics,
held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging
Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought
together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies,
memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. The street action
included 300 women, the majority of whom are victims and survivors of
violence. Together with theatre and dance artists, they created a living,
active and poetic presence, staging an aesthetics of resistance. This event
made visible to Colombia and to the world the disappearances and forced
displacements, the systematic assassinations of political leaders in the
country, and the youth who are presented as 'false positives.' Those who
are missing were remembered by walking through a series of panels, which
reflected the void created by their absence.  Patricia Ariza is a Colombian
playwright, director and actress. Forty years ago she founded 'Teatro La
Candelaria' with Santiago García. She is currently the director of
'Corporación La Candelaria' in Bogotá.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Mexico’s Violeta Luna presented 'NK 603: Action for Performer & e-Corn'
as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance
and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. The
performance was a reflection on genetically-modified corn and its
disastrous consequences for life—for the original natural species as well
as for the communities that have cultivated corn since ancient times,
developing entire cultures around it. Luna is an actress and a performance
artist. Violeta Luna obtained her graduate degree in Acting from the Centro
Universitario de Teatro in Mexico City. Since 1998 she has been an
associate artist of La Pocha Nostra under the direction of Guillermo
Gómez-Peña. Her current work explores the relationship between theater,
performance, and community engagement.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Mapa Teatro’s 'Martian Operetta' (Opereta marciana) was presented as a
part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event
brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.  'Martian
Operetta' was a remake of the Mexican film Blue Demon y las Invasoras. It
revisited, through the art of travestism, the influence that Mexican
popular music and narrative film had on the Colombian imaginary. This film
was projected while Crystal, Charlotte and Linda Lucía Callejas perform a
live lip sync of sumptuous love songs. Mapa Teatro has produced a
wide-ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and
site-specific installation. Committed to experimentation, and less
interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,' they describe their
projects as 'a laboratory for the social imaginary' that offer a space for
presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance
projects.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    David Lozano presented 'Marca y Ego, oficios para el cuerpo' as a part of
the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics,
held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging
Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought
together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies,
memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Lozano’s work
investigates how the body is constructed and conceptualized within
institutions of state control. The alternate title for this performance,
'12 Physical-Rhytmical Exercises of the Americas, without Weapons,'
proposes compelling questions about the construction of the physical and
the political body, always fluctuating between the individualistic and the
social, and resisting or assimilating institutional conventions. The fact
that performance was presented at the entrance of the Universidad Nacional
de Bogotá also implies a reflection about the autonomy of this institution
in relation to other organisms of control. David Lozano is a visual artist
with a specialization in painting. He has a Masters degree in Visual and
Fine Arts from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. He teaches at the
Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Unviersidad de los Andes, Santo Tomás de
Aquino and the Academy of Superior Arts of Bogotá. Currently he is a
teacher and the director of the School of Visual Arts at the Universidad
Nacional de Colombia. As an artist, his work has focused on the
investigation of the pós-moderno and globalized body.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Colombia’s Andrés Murillo presented 'Monosabio' as a part of the 7th
Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in
August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship:
Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together
activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories,
struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. This site-specific project took
place at the Santamaría bullring in downtown Bogotá. A bull was drawn on
the sand, and then set on fire after nightfall; the silhouette was then
erased, but as more attempts were made to erase it, the more visible it
became. This performance exposed the vicious circle of the bullfighter
assistant, the ‘monosabio,’ which is born and dies in an eternal
return.  This performance explores the notions of life and death, both
contradictory and complementary –the  ‘monosabio’ tries to clean the
trace of the death, just to set up the stage for more deaths. In doing this
action in a space situated in downtown Bogotá, the performance addresses
the current violent political situation in Colombia, and questions the
problematic and non-natural circle of life and death that this context
implies. Andrés Sebastían Murillo Espinosa is an art student at the
Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano. Since beginning his studies he has
developed a rigorous process that involves working with different artistic

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'La furia de los dioses'  was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of
the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of
2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural
Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism,
scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles,
and frontiers of citizenship. As a part of the Encuentro, performance
artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of late-night performances that
were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the
ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every
night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style
performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic
experimentation and exchange. One of these performances was 'La furia de
los dioses,' an exercise in pop blasphemy, an ecclesiastical experiment in
heathenism. Written and performed by Susana Cook, 'La furia de los dioses'
was a sharp political satire of biblical proportions that skewered the
sacred and eviscerated evangelical fundamentalism suggesting that it may be
the principal obstacle that stands in the way to intercultural
understanding, creating a rhetoric of the state in order to justify
segregation and oppression. All these issues were intertwined with a
humoristic self-criticism, playing with the idea that evangelical
fundamentalism might have mistaken where ‘heaven’ can be found. Susana
Cook is a New-York based Argentine playwright, performer, and director. 
She has presented her work as an independent artist for over 20 years. Her
originial plays include: The UnPatriotic Act: Homeland Insecurities, The
Values Horror Show, 100 Years of Attitude, Dykenstein, Hamletango, and Hot
Tamale, among others. The recipient of numerous fellowships and honors, she
has presented her work globally in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Spain,
India, Ecuador, and Canada.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'Show Business,' by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard of 2boys.tv, was
presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia,
under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.'
This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around
the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.
As a part of the Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook coordinated a
series of late-night performances that were staged in Mapa Teatro’s
theater space – an old house where the ruins of the past coexist with the
vitality of live performances. Every night, participants presented short,
sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro
into an open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. One of these
performances was 'Show Business,' a lip-synch performance, with which
2boys.tv splice together iconic American popular cultural motifs with
images generated by the western world’s first great propaganda machine:
The Vatican. This collision of Broadway, Hollywood, and Catholicism reveals
both the funny and frightening correlations between the church and show
business.  2boys.tv is a transdisciplinary duo from Montreal, Canada
composed by Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard (also notoriously known in
some circles as alter egos Gigi L’Amour and Pipi Douleur). They have
created a wide repertoire of epic multimedia cabaret works, performances,
videos, and installations.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'Given Over to Want' (Entrgados al deseo) was presented as a part of the
7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics,
held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging
Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought
together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies,
memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.As a part of the
Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of
late-night performances that were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space
– an old house where the ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of
live performances. Every night, participants presented short, sometimes
impromptu, cabaret-style performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an
open site for artistic experimentation and exchange. One of these
performances was 'Given Over to Want', a piece where sculpting the body
with tape, shadow-play, and boxed wine all provided material for the
exploration between human want, both natural and contrived. The performance
dealt with the themes of transformation, desire, and desirability. The
precariousness of citizenship crumbles into an image as primordial as it is
hungry, both fully human and fully alien. Bustamante is a performance
artist born in California. Her work encompasses performance art,
installation, video, pop music, and experimental rips in time. She is
currently teaching New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, New York.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    
'A Lesson on Hemi Esperanto' was presented as a part of the 7th Encuentro
of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of
2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural
Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism,
scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles,
and frontiers of citizenship. As a part of the Encuentro, performance
artist Susana Cook coordinated a series of late-night performances that
were staged in Mapa Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the
ruins of the past coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every
night, participants presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style
performances, transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic
experimentation and exchange. One of these performances was 'A Lesson on
Hemi Esperanto,' a spoken word work that questions and plays with
intercultural 'understanding,' ultimately privileging the bilingual
audience members able to navigate the multiple layers of mistranslation and
double meanings. This video documentation represents a unique opportunity
to better understand the transnational-hemispheric perspective promoted by
the ‘Encuentros.’ Guillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer
and the director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He
was born in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been
exploring cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual
poetry, journalism, video, radio, and installation art. His performance
work and eight books have contributed to the debates on cultural diversity,
identity, and US-Mexico relations. His art work has been presented at over
seven hundred venues across the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia
and Australia. He is a MacArthur Fellow, American Book Award winner, and a
Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. He
is a regular contributor to National Public Radio, a writer for newspapers
and magazines in the US, Mexico, and Europe, and a contributing editor to
The Drama Review (NYU-MIT).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    This impromptu spoken word duel between Guillermo Gómez Peña & Susana
Cook was presented as part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá,
Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the
Americas.' This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and
art around the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of
citizenship. As a part of the Encuentro, performance artist Susana Cook
coordinated a series of late-night performances that were staged in Mapa
Teatro’s theater space – an old house where the ruins of the past
coexist with the vitality of live performances. Every night, participants
presented short, sometimes impromptu, cabaret-style performances,
transforming Mapa Teatro into an open site for artistic experimentation and
exchange. Both Susana Cook and Gómez Peña are well known for their spoken
word works; for this reason, this video documentation of their ‘duel’
is a unique opportunity for enjoying their art and their playful dialogue.
Staged as a jam session of poetry, both performers explore issues regarding
power, complicity, nation, and gender. Their interaction transformed the
surface of the table into a ludic field upon which an emerging community of
performers and spectators engaged in a convivial meeting. This experience
offered compelling questions about how performance is never a finished
product, but an ongoing process of creation and transformation. Guillermo
Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of the
transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico City
and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring cross-cultural

Homeland Insecurities, The Values Horror Show, 100 Years of Attitude,
Dykenstein, Hamletango, and Hot Tamale, among others. The recipient of
numerous fellowships and honors, she has presented her work globally in
Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Spain, India, Ecuador, and Canada.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    'Two Simultaneous Performances' was presented as a part of the 7th
Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held in
August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title 'Staging Citizenship:
Cultural Rights in the Americas.' This 10-day event brought together
activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of legacies, memories,
struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. Although their projects emerged
from different geographical contexts and different performance languages,
Bruguera and Gómez-Peña engaged in a 'performatic conversation' whose
goal was to 'coexist and co-create a parallel, temporary universe' as 'an
act of international reconciliation.' This is a video documentation of
Guillermo Gómez Peña’s collaboration for 'Two Simultaneous
Performances': in '10 Psychomagical Actions Against Violence,' Gómez-Peña
explored both the legacy of fear of the Other—the criminalization of the
brown body inherited by the Bush administration—and the emerging culture
of hope, imagination and faith that has developed in response to the former
world order.  Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director
of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico
City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring
cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry,
journalism, video, radio, and installation art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Tania Bruguera presented 'Two Simultaneous
Performances' as a part of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute
of Performance and Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia,
under the title 'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas.'
This 10-day event brought together activism, scholarship, and art around
the themes of legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship.
Although their projects emerged from different geographical contexts and
different performance languages, Bruguera and Gómez-Peña engaged in a
'performatic conversation' whose goal was to 'coexist and co-create a
parallel, temporary universe' as 'an act of international reconciliation.'
This is a video documentation of Tania Bruguera’s contribution to the
conversation, 'Untitled (Bogotá, 2009),' presented as part of the artist's
series around political stereotypes of specific countries. In this
controversial piece, Bruguera brought together a panel of Colombian people
who had been directly affected by their country's national conflict around
drugs, to discuss their concerns and share their diverging points of view.
Unbeknownst to them, the audience, and the curators of the event, Bruguera
had arranged for a tray of cocaine to be circulated throughout the space.
As the cocaine was freely offered by a kind of cocaine 'server,' focus
quickly shifted from the panel to the audience. Some were confused, some
were outraged, others engaged in drug use. All of this complicated the
issues addressed by the panel speakers—the Colombian war on drugs and
those who suffer its consequences—creating a clash between the victims of
the conflict and the very drug that is ostensibly at the center of that
conflict. Tania Bruguera is a political artist who works primarily in
'behavior art' (arte de conducta). Her work explores the role of the
audience in performances, and the relationship between ethics and desire.
In 2002 she created the Cátedra Arte de Conducta, the first center in
Havana dedicated to the study of political art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Tour
de fuerza,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and performed in New York
City’s Dance Theater Workshop. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer,
dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at
the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón,
the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after,
Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the
company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as
‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental
dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with
Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she
has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States,
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a
teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and
improvisation. ‘Tour de fuerza’ was a project conceived and directed by
the end of the 1980s by Dance Theater Workshop’s executive director David
White. The project included works by choreographers, filmmakers, perfomers,
visual artists, etc. This video presents Viveca Vázquez’ participation
in the project, which includes three pieces: The first one, ‘Mascando
inglés’ (Chewing English), is an experimental dance choreography that
works with the body in the context of the Puerto Rico-U.S. migration and
the linguistic displacement that this migration generates. The
performers’ bodies oscillate between orientation and disorientation,
rhythmic movements and dislocation, sound and silence. These bodies are
both linguistically and physically displaced. However, ‘Mascando
inglés’ explores the ways in which the language of the body could entail
other forms of communication. The second piece, ‘Entendido’
(Under-stood), offers a choreography that intends to be synchronized;
however, the most important part of this movement is each individual body
and its particularities, given that dialogue implies assuming differences.
The political content is highlighted by the presence of Puerto Rican and
American flags -- a symbol that positions the body between balance and
unbalance, and a power that forces a disciplined body to obey several rules
at the same time, but also impulses that body to subvert them. The third
piece, ‘Las fumadoras’ (The Smokers), presents feminine bodies and
their relationship between themselves and with various objects. The piece
offers a sensation of intimacy and sharing, but also disappearance,
silence, and darkness. By the minute the bodies are hardly visible, and
only their movements reaffirm that they are a live presence. This
physicality is finally accompanied by singing voices, which gives a glimpse
of a possible sisterhood and freedom.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of experimental dance performance ‘Sui-(We),’
created and choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and Sally Silvers, and
performed in New York City’s Performance Space 122. Viveca Vázquez is a
choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance
for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work
with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and,
shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director.
Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced
events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the
experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was
co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto.
Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the
United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of
other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on
body conscience and improvisation. Sally Silvers is a New York-based
choreographer who has performed nationally and internationally in South
Korea, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Europe, the American Dance Festival, and many
other locations. As an artistic director, Sally Silvers has an on-going
fascination with the poetic as well as the social meanings of movement.
‘Sui-(We)’ is a collaborative creation that places on stage two
feminine bodies struggling with their own corporeality. The piece questions
pre-conceptions of what a feminine body is and how it moves, and in doing
this it offers a rethinking of gender identities. Both bodies are in
contact but disconnected at the same time, functioning as support and
impulse to each other; this dialogue and counterpoint is continuous, given
that while a body expands, the other contracts. This game between
connection and disconnection mirrors a dislocation between movement, sound,
and silence. In this manner, the performance presents bodies-in-between,
which reassure their existence and their political significance only
through a shared corporeality and collaborative movement.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Viveca Vázquez’ Puerto Rican experimental dance
performance ‘Malajuste’ (Maladjustment). Viveca Vázquez is a
choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance
for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work
with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and,
shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director.
Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced
events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the
experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was
co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto.
Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the
United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of
other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on
body conscience and improvisation. ‘Malajuste’ is a Taller de Otra
Cosa’s proposal, created as a collective collaboration with a group of
young people to work on dance, and to develop a space of co-creation,
exploration, and study. This performance includes four pieces: The first
one, ‘Mast-urbana,’ plays with sexuality topics, and gender roles, in a
society marked by taboo. The video insert explores topics such as
sexuality, religion, masturbation, and guilt, and the relationship with the
own body; the presence of this video also points out the role of visuality
in our body self-perception. The second piece, ‘Mira y qué’ questions
pre-concepts of what a masculine body might be, and subverts the
relationship between the masculine and the feminine. The feminine
‘voice’ is also questioned through the resource of lip-synching. The
third piece, ‘Nacedós’ contrasts quotidian movement vs. very
oppressive sound. In this manner, the piece proposes one of the main
concerns of this performance: how to ‘adjust’? How does the language of
the body adjust to external inputs, like sound; and also to ‘constructed’
inputs, like gender roles, or visuality? Finally, the last piece,
‘Vieques no es un pescao’ is dedicated to Vieques Island and Puerto
Rico, and their resistance against army tests by the US military. This
island is referred as a zone of disaster; however, the question about which
force is more harmful, the natural forces or the human forces -- with their
political and economical greed -- remains open. With this last part, the
idea of “adjustment” involves a political turn and a component of
social concern that includes Puerto Rico in the reflection presented on
stage.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance
‘Kan’t Translate – Tradúcelo,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez
and performed in the University of Puerto Rico. Viveca Vázquez is a
choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance
for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work
with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and,
shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director.
Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced

Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the
United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of
other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on
body conscience and improvisation. ‘Kan’t Translate’ explores the
idea of speaking bodies on stage and questions the language that we pretend
to ‘understand.’ The second part of the title, ‘Tradúcelo’
(Translate it), addresses the audience, and shows a trusting in the
capacity of communication through the language of the body. This piece
contrasts harmony and rupture, as well as individual movements and group
movements, exploring a different notion of the idea of ‘choreography.’
Also, the continuous alternation between absences and presences on stage
dialogues with the video insert that presents a letter to ‘Dear Mr.
Governor, Majesty,’ which becomes another kind of ‘presence’ on
stage, both made of words and rooted in political power. The last part of
this performance explores the language of dance and theatre, and
incorporates humor as another form of communication and political
satire.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance
‘Riversa,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquea, a choreographer, dancer,
and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the
University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the
first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de
Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she
presented her choreographic work and produced events such as
‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental
dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with
Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she
has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States,
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a
teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and
improvisation. ‘Riversa’ intends to delineate Viveca Vázquez’ own
style, and to show her origins in exploring the absurdity of the movements
and proposing dance as a way of thinking. On stage, the individual body and
the collective body are in dialogue and conflict at the same time, as their
movements oscillate between flow and struggling, sound and silence,
immobility and movement. The questions proposed are: what is a body? How to
make the body ‘fit’ into pre-notions of shape, movement, and even
‘choreography’? In exploring these questions Viveca Vázquez has
developed what she calls ‘Choreography of the Error’ -- based on
quotidian movements and diverse bodies, Vázquez challenges the

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance
‘Riversa,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquea, a choreographer, dancer,
and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the
University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the
first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de
Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the company she
presented her choreographic work and produced events such as
‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental
dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with
Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she
has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States,
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a
teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and
improvisation. ‘Riversa’ intends to delineate Viveca Vázquez’ own
style, and to show her origins in exploring the absurdity of the movements
and proposing dance as a way of thinking. On stage, the individual body and
the collective body are in dialogue and conflict at the same time, as their
movements oscillate between flow and struggling, sound and silence,
immobility and movement. The questions proposed are: what is a body? How to
make the body ‘fit’ into pre-notions of shape, movement, and even
‘choreography’? In exploring these questions Viveca Vázquez has
developed what she calls ‘Choreography of the Error’ -- based on
quotidian movements and diverse bodies, Vázquez challenges the
audience’s expectations of what should be performed on stage. At the same
time, she problematizes what is conceived as a ‘Puerto Rican body’: is
this pure physicality or it is a political construction?

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘¡Uy!
-- Opera de Terror,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez and performed in
the University of Puerto Rico, Recinto Río Piedras. Viveca Vázquez is a
choreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance
for actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work
with Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and,
shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director.
Through the company she presented her choreographic work and produced
events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the
experimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was
co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto.
Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in the
United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of
other places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on
body conscience and improvisation. ‘¡Uy!’ explores the concept of
offering an opera not with voices but with bodies. There is an operatic
counterpoint between frightening music and bodies that seem to be lost;
between showing and hiding; between light and shadows; and between
movements and immobility. These bodies are literally moving in the edge,
verging on the unbalance; in this manner, horror seems to be more a state
of the body that a state of mind. The stage is divided based on the
different rooms that a house can contain -- in this manner, this
performance is related to the space as a concept, and to an exploration of
memory, fear, and being afraid of fear. ‘¡Uy!’ proposes several
questions: What is that which scares us? Our surroundings?  Or the objects
with which we interact in our everyday life? What is our relationship with
our own body? How and when does the body die? How are death and horror
related to the death of the body as a corporeal reality?

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance
‘Plagio,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez, who is a choreographer,
dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at
the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón,
the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after,
Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the
company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as
‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental
dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with
Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she
has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States,
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a
teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and
improvisation. ‘Plagio’ was performed in the Estudios Generales Letras
building, at the University of Puerto Rico. While taking over the space
with bodies, sound, voices, and movement, Vázquez performed a double
gesture, bringing a canonic text to the dance, and bringing it in dance to
non-conventional spaces. The reverberation of voices and movement resembles
the idea of plagiarism (‘plagio’), which in this case is understood as
a re-enactment and re-creation of the classics. This video documentary is
described as a ‘Piece of dance-theater inspired in Augustine of Hippo.’
The implications of bringing Saint Augustine to the University of Puerto
Rico engage this performance with contemporary concerns, related to the
discussion on colonialism and post-colonialism. Also, including new codes
and forms of expression such as rap music stages the dialogue and
counterpoint between our times and the classic texts. This video as a
‘documentary by Miguel Villafañe, ‘plagiarism’ of a performance by
Viveca Vázquez, in turn a ‘plagiarism’ of Saint Augustine of Hippo’s
life and works.’ With this playful idea, this performance and its video
documentary offer a rich line of discussion about re-creations: if this
documentary is a ‘plagiarism’ of a ‘plagiarism’ of a
‘plagiarism,’ perhaps its presence in the Hemispheric Institute Digital
Video Library could be considered another ‘plagiarism’ in the series of
re-enactments that are at the basis of our cultural constructions.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance
‘mAroma,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez, who is a choreographer,
dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors at
the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón,
the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after,
Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through the
company she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as
‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimental
dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with
Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she
has produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States,
Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a
teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and
improvisation. ‘mAroma’ is a stage adaptation based on Virgil’s The
Aeneid, Pasolini’s Mamma Roma, and Tollinchis’ Rome’s Metamorphosis.
The Aeneid is the poem for Augustus’ Imperial Rome’s foundation. Circa
29 BC, Virgil was the best poet in the city and Augustus was victorious
after a long war period. Augustus entrusted Virgil to write the poem of his
glory. Three books are central in the this epic poem, IV and V, where the
narration presents the love between Dido, Queen of Carthage and Aeneas; and
book VI, where Aeneas goes to the Avernus to meet his father Anquises’
shadow. mAroma adapts these books and adds a new viewpoint by using Pier
Paolo Pasolini’s Mamma Roma. As Mara Negrón points out in the playbill
for the staging of this piece in March and April 2006, ‘mAroma navigates
through the fragments of these stories without intending a lineal narration
of the episodes. The characters circulate in a city without and identity --
it can be any city, any street in the world. Rome is not Rome, but a place
of transit, riddled with encounters and misunderstandings, where the
characters visit their own desires’ shadows, where the characters turn
somersaults (‘hacen maromas’) in-between their past and their present.
And at the same time, Rome is always Rome -- a place inhabited by its past.
The characters of mAroma are yesterday and are today.’ In giving bodies
to these characters, the performers insert themselves in the continuous
dialogue between history and present, and the embodiment of that
relationship on stage.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Video documentation of Puerto Rican experimental dance performance ‘Miss
Puerto Rico o La isla que se repite,’ choreographed by Viveca Vázquez as
a part of ‘A alboroto limpio,’ a project organized and directed by
Nelson Rivera, which also included dance pieces by Oscar Mestey and Awilda
Sterling. Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer, dancer, and a professor of
humanities and contemporary dance for actors at the University of Puerto
Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón, the first experimental
dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of
which she became the first director. Through the company she presented her
choreographic work and produced events such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key
festival in the development of the experimental dance and performance scene
in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based
in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 she has produced and performed
experimental dance works in the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and
Argentina, among a great number of other places. As a teacher she has
developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience and improvisation.
‘Miss Puerto Rico o la isla que se repite’ is a contemporary
experimental dance and performance that dialogues with the cultural climate
in Puerto Rico. Vázquez reflects upon the figure of Miss Puerto Rico
performing in bath clothes and a ‘crown’ with the shape of the island.
The logic of beauty contests is questioned by the contrast between
‘graceful’ movements and a struggling body, which is a tool and an
obstacle at the same time. The political implications of this dance
performance suggest a major role of the citizens in Puerto Rico’s
sovereignty: how is ‘the island,’ as a geographical body, related to
the physical body, and the political body?

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    ¿¡Qué Nuevas!? - What’s New!?, Latina Theatre  Lab’s first Original
Musical Comedy, examined stereotypes within the Entertainment Industry
through the varied experiences of eleven Latina actresses. With Carmen
Miranda as an icon, interwoven with video interviews of the performers,
this work explores self-image, self-doubt, and finally self-acceptance by
dropping the mask and singing 'Mamá yo quiero!'
Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of
writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch
work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and
the complexities of 'being Latina.' The group was founded in 1994 by four
San Francisco Bay Area actresses known as the 'comadres': Dena Martinez,
Jaime Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to
create theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of
roles for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were
scarce, and rarely defied racial stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina
Theatre Lab's work played with these cultural and gender stereotypes,
exploring the legacies they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They
also collaborated with fellow comedy troupes in California, such as Culture
Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty Mountain
Warriors.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    La Peña Cultural Center first hosted Latina Theatre Lab, Culture Clash,
and 18 Mighty Mountain Warriors for a Comedy Slam. They reworked their
cross-cultural sketch comedy and add different material for the New
Langston show. Some women from The Asian American Theater Company had
formed a writing group to support and give feed back to each other. Latina
Theatre Lab collaborated with them, exploring similarities in dealing with
discrimination as well as cultural stereotypes that Latinos and Asians have
about each other. 
Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of
writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch
work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities,and the
complexities of 'being Latina.' The group was founded in 1994 by four San
Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa
Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that
would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which
Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely
defied racial stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played
with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they
inherited both as Latinas and as women.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    The Immaculate Conception is a play that explores Virgin, Mother, Whore
mythology and stereotypes. Body types and image topics were developed in a
workshop: What does a Virgin look like?  A Whore?  A Latina?  Do we get
these ideas from magazines?  Television?  Men? Each other? Is there a God?
A Goddess? And why are all Latinas expected to know how to salsa dance???

Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of
writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch
work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and

    This production, in collaboration with the Working Women Festival, is a

Goddess? And why are all Latinas expected to know how to salsa dance???

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Co-Madres (co-founders)  talk about the creation of Latina Theatre Lab and
the creative process of producing original work with 'El Amanecer' host,
Isabel Lucero. An excerpt of  'The Miracle,' from The Immaculate
Conception, is part of this video. 
Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of
writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch
work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and
the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San
Francisco Bay Area actresses known as the 'comadres': Dena Martinez, Jaime
Lujan, Tessa Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create
theater that would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles
for which Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce,
and rarely defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work
played with these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies
they inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also have collaborated

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Latina Theater Lab developed acting workshops and Ranchera singing classes
led by ensemble member Yolanda Aranda, who asked: What kind of music did
you listen to at home? As each participant answered the questions, stories
began to unfold through songs that evoked a cherished memory or a painful
loss. During the eight-week workshop, participants were all required to
memorize and perform a song they had chosen in true Ranchera style. This is
a video documentation of two developmental workshops where members of the
ensemble share their performance composition method with the
audience.
Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of
writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch
work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and
the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San
Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa
Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Commissioned by Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (1998-1999 Wattis
Artist-in-residence, established by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Wattis with
leadership support from Catherine and Ted Topham), this is a staged reading
of a play-in-progress drawing from personal histories and memories
triggered by the music and lyrics of rancheras. This series of eloquent
monologues is expressed in three movements. 'Once' is comprised of stories
passed from people never known, now long gone. The movement 'Jump' reveals
observations of the family, revealed by little girls’ eyes. The third
movement, 'Forte,' presents reflections of who we are today.

Latina Theatre Lab was one of the first and only all-Latina collective of
writers, performers, and directors in the U.S. Their performance-sketch
work dealt with pop culture, immigration, cross-cultural identities, and
the complexities of 'being Latina.' It was founded in 1994 by four San
Francisco Bay Area actresses: Dena Martinez, Jaime Lujan, Tessa
Koning-Martinez and Wilma Bonet. Their purpose was to create theater that
would go beyond the ever shrinking and limited range of roles for which
Latina actresses were being considered. These roles were scarce, and rarely
defied stereotypes. From 1994-1999, Latina Theatre Lab's work played with
these cultural and gender stereotypes, exploring the legacies they
inherited both as Latinas and as women. They also have collaborated with
Culture Clash, the Asian American Theater Company, and the 18 Mighty
Mountain Warriors.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Commissioned by Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (1998-1999 Wattis
Artist-in-residence, established by 
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Wattis with leadership support from Catherine and Ted
Topham), this is the third incarnation of Latina Theater Lab’s Last Stop
Ranchera. Drawing on personal histories and memories, seven women discover
stories of love, betrayal, loss, shattered dreams and, ultimately, pride.
The play has three movements: 'Once' – Stories from the past and about
ancestors; 'Jump' – Stories about family and growing up, viewed through
little girls’ eyes; 'Forte' – Observations that try to explain and to
assume who we are today.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Teatro Jornalero Sin Fronteras /Day Laborers Theater Without Borders (TJSF)
is a Los Angeles-based ensemble theater company comprised of day laborers.
Founded in 2008 by Cornerstone Theater Company in conjunction with the
National Day Labor Organizing Network, their mission is to improve the
lives of day laborers by creating plays by and for the day labor community.
 Responding to an often degrading and hostile work environment and an
increasingly anti-immigrant climate nationally, the troupe uses theater,
music, and dialogue to educate and inform immigrant workers about their
legal rights; to empower the community by reflecting their stories in their
own voices; to humanize the immigration debate for the broader community;
and to build a troupe of theater artists that make insightful, entertaining
and smart theater for their audiences. Each year TJSF performs in over 50
locations for more than 3,000 day laborers, public school and college
students, and diverse organizations, institutions, and agencies. They have
received coverage in local, national and international media outlets,
including La Opinion, LA Times, BBC World, Christian Science Monitor, and
National Public Radio. 

In 'Esclavitud Moderna' (Modern Slavery), a Hispanic man and a woman,
husband and wife, are rushing to get to their job, which is ran by an older
white man. The wife is hired to clean offices and household, whereas the
husband is hired to clean yards as a gardener. The boss assigns the husband
to go out and clean the yard so that he can stay at the office with the
wife to stare at her body as she cleans the office, especially the floor.
She is exposed to toxic chemicals from cleaning products, not to mention
the sexual harassment. Both laborers also have unfair work conditions and
late or nonexistent payment. However, when they complain, the boss decides
to call La Migra, or immigration, and turn in the husband and wife, given
that they are not either legal residents or citizens in this country. When
the couple decides to leave without their payment, the boss, as if it is
another regular business day, puts a sign up in front of the office that
says, 'There is work. No papers and no English necessary. Good pay.' This
gesture demonstrates the dehumanization and interchangeability that
characterizes immigrant lives in the midst of exploitation situations and
laws.

In ‘Salud’ (Health), people wait for their lab test results in a health
clinic. One by one they are called by a doctor who informs them of
different illness caused by sexually transmitted disease, toxic chemical
contamination in blood and other organs, and malnutrition. These diagnoses
revealed lack of sexual education, health education on chemicals and
toxins, lack of proper equipment from their work, and most importantly,
lack of food education – all of them key problems among immigrant and
impoverished populations.

‘Químicos’ (Chemicals) is a story in three parts. The first part
recreates how day laborers are hired on the streets to do dangerous works,
where they will use toxic chemicals and will not use proper equipment for
protection. The second part describes the dangerous conditions in which day
laborers work, and the difficult they have in seeking professional health
physicians when they are ill. The third part reflects upon the health of
Hispanic/Latino communities, which are prone to different types of illness
and diseases because of the types of food they consume - heavily greased,
high in sugar and sodium. This type of nutrition leads to high numbers of
Hispanic/Latino having diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.
The ending of this piece is full of humor but reflexive, and advocates for
a proper education and information about these situations to prevent
illness and death.

‘Demolición’ (Demolition) is a play about a group of day laborers
hired to demolish a house that needs various repairs. Since these workers
hardly speak any English to understand the address and instructions given
to them, they search for someone who can translate. However, due to a
miscommunication, they end up demolishing the wrong house. When the owners
of the demolished house arrived, there is a succession of events both comic
and tragic. Finally, the leader of the group, who made the contract, flees
and leaves the rest of the day laborers behind without payment while
shouting 'It was horrible, it was horrible comrades. You will get paid on
the day of your judgment.' This piece reflects upon the injustices and lack
of solidarity that immigrant laborers have to confront.

‘Caminos al Paraíso’ (Paths to Paradise) is a story in three parts. It
narrates all the adrenaline, fear, and insecurities experienced by
immigrants when traveling from Mexico to the U.S.A. They are victims of the
greed and violence from people who impose undignified and humiliating acts
on them. These victimizers are different organized gangs; the ‘coyotes’
who take undocumented emigrants across the U.S.A. border; and the police
who make millions off of illegal emigrants. Immigrants lose their dignities
as human beings because they are treated like animals and violated by
others along the way. Both women and men are abducted, raped, or murdered
by criminals to extort their families who live in the United States – and
when some immigrants fight for their human rights, they are killed. This
piece is a cry for help and solidarity by the Mexicans living in the United
States under unfair immigration policies, and a message abou the harsh
reality implied in the act of crossing borders.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    Teatro Jornalero Sin Fronteras /Day Laborers Theater Without Borders (TJSF)
is a Los Angeles-based ensemble theater company comprised of day laborers.
Founded in 2008 by Cornerstone Theater Company in conjunction with the
National Day Labor Organizing Network, their mission is to improve the
lives of day laborers by creating plays by and for the day labor community.
 Responding to an often degrading and hostile work environment and an
increasingly anti-immigrant climate nationally, the troupe uses theater,
music, and dialogue to educate and inform immigrant workers about their
legal rights; to empower the community by reflecting their stories in their
own voices; to humanize the immigration debate for the broader community;
and to build a troupe of theater artists that make insightful, entertaining
and smart theater for their audiences. Each year TJSF performs in over 50
locations for more than 3,000 day laborers, public school and college
students, and diverse organizations, institutions, and agencies. They have
received coverage in local, national and international media outlets,
including La Opinion, LA Times, BBC World, Christian Science Monitor, and
National Public Radio. 

‘Bailando con La Migra’ (Dancing with Homeland Security) is a
tragicomic, educative, and reflexive play about immigrants, whose luck can
change from one minute to the next when searching for work, waiting for the
bus, or taking their kids to school. Their lives are marked by the threat
of being arrested by Homeland Security, the laws that poorly defend the
immigrants, and the lack of proper knowledge of how to act in front of an
official. An actor who plays the Forum Theater's Joker figure is introduced
to interact with the audience as the play unfolds. At the end, there is
hope that all undocumented immigrants and the agents of Homeland Security
will come together and celebrate a better, united world. This educative
play’s message for the audience is to go out and fight for immigration
reform for all the 12 million undocumented people who live in the United
States.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Interview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor,
founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics.
In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez talks about Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz
and her poem ‘Primero Sueño’ (‘First Dream’), a baroque work of
art that condenses the genius of the 17th-century Mexican nun. She is
linked through memory, history, and feminist statements with her
contemporary counterpart, Jesusa Rodríguez, who memorized the almost 1,000
verses of the poem as a part of a creative process that allowed her not
only to develop a profound interpretation of its contents, but also a fully
bodily internalization experience. This intense relationship with the poem
helped her to survive in the everyday world, to strengthen her political
struggle, and to fight oblivion. For Jesusa Rodríguez, Sor Juana’s
poetry is both a-temporal and contemporary, and a source of inspiration and
wisdom to keep working on acts of resistance. As a tribute, Jesusa
Rodríguez uses theater to transmit the greatest poem of one of the
greatest Mexican poets, and to make it visible and accessible to everyone.
Diverse stage elements serve as tools to reveal specific parts of the poem,
through a ‘striptease,’ or an autopsy that helps to understand the
beauty of Sor Juana’s words.

[BIO] Jesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and
political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often
referred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and
with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her
work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic
boundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret;
from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to
performative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábito
in Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundreds
of shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up the
Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using
‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Interview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor,
founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics.
In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez talks about the relationship between
her experience in theater and cabaret, and her political commitment as an
activist. She considers that cabaret provides improvisation as a training
tool to exercise negotiation and risk. Also, the immediate response of the
audience transforms the artist into a medium that conveys what the public
feels and thinks; in this sense, cabaret is a space both to become aware of
the current political situation and to foresee what could be upcoming,
which engenders a more participative audience. Jesusa Rodríguez and her
Resistencia Creativa movement organized a massive ‘plantón’ (sit-in)
in Mexico City’s Zócalo (main square) to protest against the
controversial results of the Presidential Elections in 2006. She brought
together different groups and art expressions from a wide range of Mexican
citizens and collaborators, and they presented different spectacles every
day during this 40-days sit-in. This demonstration was an example of the
art’s role in the struggle for a country’s transformation as well as an
act of generosity and solidarity. Based on her ‘artivist’ experiences,
Jesusa Rodríguez asks: how art and resistance transform and energize the
people little by little every day?

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Interview with Jesusa Rodríguez, conducted by Diana Taylor,
founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics.
In this interview, Jesusa Rodríguez discusses the possibility of
developing a non-Western, Mesoamerican acting technique, based in a
pre-Hispanic conception of the human being, which understands the body in a
conjunction of mind and spirit. Jesusa Rodríguez follows Alfredo Federico
López Austin’s research on the Aztec worldview and on Mesoamerican
religion, and explains how she concentrates her strength in bodily
channeling the persons she characterizes in her shows. In the second part
of this interview, she channels La Malinche, the interpreter and lover of
Hernán Cortés in Mexico’s Conquest, to tell her true story. Through
this example, and in a dialogue with contemporary indigenous communities’
struggles, Jesusa Rodríguez proposes alternative ways of knowledge, and
alternative art and performance techniques, based on indigenous worldviews.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Marlène Ramírez-Cancio and Claire Crosby interview Jesusa
Rodríguez and Liliana Felipe, who talk about their beginnings both as
artists and as a couple. They conceived their wedding as a performative
act, which was a symbolic statement against a law in Mexico called
“Sociedad en Convivencia” (living together in society). Their wedding
was immediately followed by their divorce as a part of a contract that
should make the couple’s life easier. As they do not believe in marriage
or in a social legalization of affect, Jesusa and Liliana talk about how
institutions impose and shape issues as sexuality, gender, and human
rights. These two wonderful women speak about how society understand
masculine and feminine; they also discuss how their art practice and
cabaret performances question women oppression and inequality of power, and
how cabaret can function as a thermometer for political struggles. For
them, revolution starts from within ourselves, and then it could expand to
transform our world. Jesusa and Liliana ran together the famous El Hábito
in Mexico City, where they staged hundreds of shows over the course of
fifteen years.

[BIO] Jesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret and
political performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Often

work challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease generic

from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, to
performative acts within political projects. Most recently, she heads up
the Resistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using
‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action. Liliana Felipe is a
composer, singer, gardener, tango musician, and clergyphobe. She left
Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in 1976, but her sister
and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000 disappeared.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Interview with Regina José Galindo, conducted by Diana Taylor,
founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics.
Regina Galindo talks about the difference of being an artist or an activist
during the years of violence in Guatemala -- she reflects upon the risks
involved in the artist’s work, finally stating that, in fact, any
Guatemalan is at risk in their quotidian lives. According with her clear,
rational vision of art, activism is something different and more involved;
for her, the role of the artist is to create artwork, which might not have
a direct impact in social change, but can promote a new dialogue among
citizens. Galindo strongly states that she does not think that she is
changing the world; however, the fact that she is not involved in a radical
change does not mean that she is not working for a better society.
Therefore, she proposes a different form of resistance, through which maybe
we are not changing the world, but at least we are not worsening
it.

[BIO] Regina José Galindo (1974) was born in Guatemala City. Her work has

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Immigrant Latina women—who have had little or no access to
education or health care—are living longer than anyone else in the United
States. The New York Times has called this phenomenon 'The Hispanic
Paradox.' What if Latinas’ longevity could be extracted from their bodies
and marketed as a health supplement to the public at large? Find out on the
hard-hitting news show, TERCER IMPACTO, as Barbi Bermúdez and Fabi
Fernández report on the new craze in energy supplements, HISPANACEA: Your
Fountain of Youth. Feel the force that is sweeping the nation!

[BIO] Fulana (www.fulana.org) is a Latina video collective from New York
City. Through parody and satire, Fulana explores themes that are relevant
to Latino cultures in the U.S., delving into the nuances that bind our
experiences, experimenting with strategies to make visible what we're so
often made to read between the lines. Their work, which consists mainly of
mock television commercials, music videos and print advertisements,
responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed to Latinos through the
mass media.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] This satirical pharmaceutical commercial by Fulana was made in
the context of the Iraq war and the Bush administration, at a time when
being a 'good American,' they felt, meant falling into a kind of political
and historical amnesia. The 'Amnezac' commercial, much in the style of
drugs like Paxil and Zoloft, asks consumers to think about their emotional
state and suggest they may need clinical treatment. 'Do you feel anxiety
about world events you cannot change?,' it asks. 'Are your political
concerns interfering with your patriotic activities, like shopping and
paying taxes? Does the Iraq war remind you of US invasions of Latin
American countries, including your own? You may be suffering from
Historical Memoritis.' It urges viewers to block their long-term historical
memory with Amnezac: The Most Powerful Anti-Historiamine on the Market.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] “Artistas de performance” was a roundtable presented as part
of the 7th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics, held in August of 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia, under the title
'Staging Citizenship: Cultural Rights in the Americas' -- a10-day event
that brought together activism, scholarship, and art around the themes of
legacies, memories, struggles, and frontiers of citizenship. This
roundtable offered an opportunity for discussion with -and between-
selected performance artists who presented work at this Encuentro. These
artists reflected upon their own process and production, and commented on
the relationship of their work to the larger themes of the Encuentro.
Wilson Díaz presented a retrospective of his visual arts work, which
reveals recent Colombian struggles with violence and drug trafficking --
his images related to natural coca leaves contrast with cocaine, its
derivative chemical drug that engenders violence. Rocío Boliver performed
an act of ventriloquism to make an artist statement, and to share her ideas
about fear, pain, and excess as ways to challenge the establishment. Tania
Bruguera explained how her ‘behavior art’ functions locally and
internationally, and what contradictions are implied when an artwork is
transplanted to a different context. Guillermo Gómez-Peña shared the
difficulties he has in explaining his work as a performance artist (an
often misunderstood practice), and the role of the body in decolonization
mechanisms. One of the central points of the following Q&A discussion was
Bruguera’s polemic piece, in which she distributed cocaine among audience
members inside the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (without the consent of
the Encuentro organizers). Part of the audience regretted the fact that her
highly controversial performance replicated the circulation of drug money
and violence that Colombia is currently suffering. This round table
provided a space for discussion and dialogue about the artist’s ethics
and responsibility, and the complexities of the relationship between
performance and politics.

[BIOS] Wilson Díaz is a founding member (1998) of Helena Productions. He
has been a professor in the Visual Arts departments at Universidad del
Valle (Cali), Conservatorio de Bellas Artes de Cali, and the Universidad de
Cauca (Popayán) a various times between 1996 and 2003.
Rocío Boliver, La Congelada de Uva, has been active in the art world for
the past ten years. She began her career as a performer in 1992 with a
reading of her porno-erotic texts, directing her criticism toward the
repression of women.
Tania Bruguera is a political artist who works primarily in behavior art
(arte de conducta). Her work explores the role of the audience in
performances and the relationship between ethics and desire. In 2002 she
created the Cátedra Arte de Conducta, the first center in Havana dedicated
to the study of political art.
Guillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the director of
the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born in Mexico
City and came to the U.S. in 1978. Since then he has been exploring
cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry,
journalism, video, radio, and installation art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In A Terra, the first impact is the geography of the sertão.
Euclides da Cunha describes each part of the sertão in the first part of
his book, revealing to the reader an x-ray of the region. In the play, a
carnival opera, an epic Brazilian musical, the actors are the earth, the
vegetation, the wind, the animals, the rivers, the drought. It reveals the
most intimate secrets of nature, that also vibrate in the human and
trans-human arteries. When this work returned as a musical overture to the
whole pentalogy, enriched by the experience that the subsequent works
brought to the creators and to the audience, it gained an updated insight
into the human interference in the environment. Destructive power is
proportional to financial power, and the discussion about the way space
gets occupied was brought to the forefront, including the real-estate boom
that surrounds today not only Teatro Oficina, but the whole world, now
hotter and more arid.

[BIO] From 2000 to 2007, Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona worked on the staging
of Euclides da Cunha's epic book, Os Sertões, which describes the 19th
Century War of Canudos in the Brazilian 'sertão,' lead by Antônio
Conselheiro. The final result was a pentalogy, formed by the plays A Terra
(2002), O Homem I (2003), O Homem II (2003), A Luta I (2005), and A Luta II
(2006), totalizing 27 hours of theater. Os Sertões reads the episodes of
the war in light of past and present Brazilian history, and in relation to
the struggle of the group against media mogul Sílvio Santos, who wanted to
tear down the historic theater.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS]  To understand the soul of the 'sertanejo' (the inhabitant of
the sertão)—what would lead the nature of this man to resist until the
last day in Canudos—Euclides da Cunha recalls in his book the formation
of Brazilian society, its telluric, animal, and tupi origin. The second
part of the book (and the second play, O Homem I), is about the vigorous
embrace of the winner, the Celtic European Colonizer, copulating with the
defeated, with the slaves from the ships, forming the 'Typeless-Brazilian'
type. Mixtures of all kinds find their space in the stage in the surprising
miscegenation already present in the cast and crew of Teatro Oficina
itself. It is the story of the Brazilian Man, the Man of the Country abroad
interbreeding with the Country inside, until the Revolt against the very
idea—imposed and imported—of man, with the appearance of Zarathustra
Antônio Conselheiro.

[BIO] From 2000 to 2007, Teat(r)o Oficina Uzyna Uzona worked on the staging
of Euclides da Cunha's epic book, Os Sertões, which describes the 19th

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Dedicated to 'the creation of an heroic and anti-heroic attitude
of those that go to war and say: Farewell Man!,' the theatrical version of
the second movement of the second part of Os Sertões presents the passage
from the re-volted man to the trans-man, creator of an alternate
possibility for human adventure on Earth. From the story of Antônio
Conselheiro, all theater relives its seminal death: a common man who, out
of love, transmutes into an anti-messianic leader, gathering a legion of
'sertanejos,' roots of solidarity in the inlands of Bahia who, in a
community effort, raise dams, churchs, and cemiteries. The community had at
one point 25 thousand inhabitants, in its days the second largest city of
Bahia. Capuchin Friars attempted to disperse the people of Canudos
'diplomatically.' Their denial to obey the official religious order led the
Evangelist Friar to damn the followers of Antônio Conselheiro in the name
of Jesus. The City prepares for war.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Dedicated to 'the poet Oswald de Andrade and to the businessman,
showman, and actor Sílvio Santos,' the third part of the book tells the
causing incident of the war, when a judge from Juazeiro stopped a shipment
of wood that was paid for from being delivered for the construction of the
New Church of Canudos. Three expeditions were sent by the National Army and
defeated, the last one commanded by the famous Colonel Moreira César. The
Army faced the humiliation of soldiers deserting and running away, and the
impaling of Colonel Tamarindo. He ended up being the main character in a
macabre installation on the road to Canudos, created by the Jagunços
(thugs from the sertão) and the Mandrakes to intimidate new expeditions.
The first movement of A Luta is written in cordel verse (popular string
literature form). A Luta I also amplifies the performance space, with
trench houses from the invincible Canudos that effectively form a spinal
cord in the runway, and the aerial spaces of the mutãs, hideouts used by
the Indians in the top branches of trees to hunt the jaguar, which the
followers of Antônio Conselheiro reinvented. Lirinha, a musician from the
Pernambuco band Cordel do Fogo Encantado, brought his passion for
soundtracks, recording sounds from the theater itself, and transforming
them into shots, artillery, creating with music the vanguard of the fight.
The physical space of the performance is extended to the world, with
recorded images, sampled, embroidered, in the streets that surround the
theater, in the dressing rooms, in places hidden from the direct sight of
the audience, making live cinema.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Dedicated to 'all the power of the Un-massacre of Art and to the
effects of the Trans-Human power of the Crowd,' the staging of the last
part of the book deals with the fourth and last expedition by the Brazilian
National Army to the Northeastern 'sertão.' 12 thousand soldiers, cannons,
and modern weapons where deployed, together with modern strategists such as
Marshal Bittencourt who, for the first time in the history of the Brazilian
Army, established an operational base away from the front, from where he
commanded the maneuvers that General Arthur Oscar and his deputy, the
blood-thirsty General Barbosa, executed. The play shows the end of the War
of Canudos, which resulted in the massacre of the sertanejos, the death of
Antônio Conselheiro himself (who went to meet God), and the destruction of
the citadel. In Teatro Oficina, the massacre is performed not as a mass for
the repetition of the martyrdom, but from the perspective of an
un-massacre. By exposing this closed abscess of Brazilian History in the
Public Square of Theater, it wishes to lance it once and for all, to purge
it from the everyday practice of Brazilian life. Canudos did not surrender,
and Euclides da Cunha ends his book by reminding us that it is not one of
defense, but of attack.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Zé Pelintra is a multicultural ambivalent figure worshiped in
the Umbanda religion as both a street-life spirit and a wise old black
ancestor. He is a master who can be simultaneously a trickster and a
healer. Zé Pelintra uses the lure of earthly pleasures as a means to
attract practitioners to his wise teachings and therapeutic goals. This
video was created for the Hemispheric Institute Encuentro 2003 in New York
City to recreate an interactive altar for Zé Pelintra. 

[BIO] Zeca Ligiéro is currently Associate Professor at the Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro State and the curator of Augusto Boal Archive.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Muiraquitã is a lucky amulet, a frog, representing knowledge and fertility in the Amerindian world. It names this project of artistic investigation on the Afro-Amerindian traditions by artist and researcher Zeca Ligiéro. The Muiraquitã project was awarded the Residência Artística 2009 grant by FUNARTE/MINC for the Ponto de Cultura Reconquering Culture, Art and Citizenship of Marajó. The city of Soure is located in the Marajó Island in the State of Pará, on the mouth of the Amazonas River. The video is a documentation of interviews with artists, popular masters, local stories and natural medicines. It also documents performances of typical dances developed by the Grupo de Dança Tradições Marajoara Cruzeirinho, two 'caboclo' rituals, an entity considered of Afro-Amerindian origin typical of the Tambor de Mina—a religion specific to the States of Pará and Maranhão—, the Casa de Fulúpa de Cabocla Ita of the Mother of Saint Iya Decy and the Terreiro de Yansã de Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Mãe Fátima. The project was completed in April 2010.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] This play tells the story of the first Brazilian black clown,
starting with his childhood during the period of slavery in Brazil, through
his running away with the circus. There he trained as a juggler,
rope-walker, and acrobat, and became a famous clown. Benjamin brought
theater to the circus, and was thus one of the precursors of the
Circus-Theater, staging classic works such as José de Alencar and Carlos
Gomes' O Guarani, as well as creating his own plays.

Zeca Ligiéro's adaptation and staging creates a contemporary performance
with a couple of black actors, based on both theater and circus techniques.
It also adds to these the storytelling of the ancient African griots,
transformed in the New World into storytellers that sometimes brought a
story lived by heroes of the past, and sometimes told a fable or ancient
myth of the African continent. All of this combined with melodrama, dance,
and song.

University of Rio de Janeiro State and the curator of Augusto Boal Archive.
He coordinates since 1998 the Center for the Study of Afro-Amerindian

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] This documentary shows a unique style of tap dancing, influenced
by slave house traditions, European immigration, and African dances—such
as the jongo—that were incorporated into Brazilian culture. This very
urban carioca tap dancing is the synthesis of Brazilian tap dancing: the
slyness of finding the rhythm and creating sound with the feet.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] Video documentation of the second part of Astrid Hadad 's
performance 'Amores Pelos' presented as a part of the 2nd Encuentro of the
Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in June of
2001 in Monterrey, Mexico under the title 'Memory, Atrocity and
Resistance'. 
[BIO] Astrid Hadad is a singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City's
Centro Universitario de Teatro. She looks to cabaret and performance to
represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the same
time, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends
popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with
highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy
Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes
them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global
contexts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] ‘Vivir muriendo’ is a cabaret-format show, where Astrid
Hadad performs a direct political satire against the aftermath of Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo’s Mexican government. Hadad’s
iconic and continuously morphing clothes are an allegory of Mexican nation,
condensed in her body and her powerful voice. Playing in the intertwining
relationship between politics and sexuality, ‘Vivir muriendo’ is a
thermometer of the Mexican political situation at the end of the 20th
century and the beginning of the 21st century. 
 [BIO] Astrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico.  Her
work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy
Nopal.’  The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus
distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of
performance.  Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad
dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She
appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and
walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings.  Through her voice and her
body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural
processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender
roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. 
Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

 [SYNOPSES] In this video documentation, Astrid Hadad develops a musical
arrangement regarding violence against women. Although her songs come from
Mexican tradition and clearly refer to Mexican women, Hadad’s comments
during the show suggests that gendered violence is endemic, and that is
suffered not only by Latin American women, but by women all around the
world. Dressed as ‘Adelita,’ iconic female figure of the Mexican
Revolution, Hadad claims a stronger position for women in society. Female
sexuality is at the center of her songs, looking for a liberation of
women’s bodies – playing with Emiliano Zapata’s words, she says that
‘the orgasm belongs to those who work for it.’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] In 2000, New York City’s SummerStage hosted a unique concert
where three powerful women offered the best of their repertoire. Astrid
Hadad, Liliana Felipe, and Eugenia León performed both individually and
together, in a show organized and directed by Jesusa Rodríguez. The
presence of these women in Central Park, singing in Spanish, speaks about
the intertwined relationship between the local and the transnational, as
well as the interest in Latin American and Latino/a culture in New York
City. The political strength of this performance comes from the voices, the
bodies, and the words of these amazing women. This video documentation
includes mostly Astrid Hadad’s participation in the show, as well as a
grand finale where she and Liliana Felipe and Eugenia León delight the
audience with smart and fun rancheras.
[BIOS] Astrid Hadad is a singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City's
Centro Universitario de Teatro. She looks to cabaret and performance to
represent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the same
time, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blends
popular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire with
highly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'Heavy
Nopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframes
them to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and global
contexts. Eugenia León is a singer born in Mexico, defined as a singer
committed to the people and their causes. She has performed all around the
world and her repertoire includes diverse genres, such as tango, bolero,
norteño, Latin American music and rancheras. The strength and versatility
of her voice makes her one of the most beloved and recognized Mexican
singers. Liliana Felipe is a composer, singer, actor, tango musician, and
clergyphobe. She left Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in
1976, but her sister and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000
disappeared. She and her partner, Jesusa Rodríguez, owned and operated El
Habito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico
City. Jesusa Rodríguez is a Mexican director, actress, playwright,
performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur and social activist, who has
been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as
both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing
with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek
tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue,
sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects.

[BIO] Astrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico.  Her
work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy

distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of
performance.  Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad
dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She
appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and
walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings.  Through her voice and her
body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural

roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] In this video documentation of ‘Faxes a Rumberta,’ Astrid
Hadad brings the female body at the center of the stage. Through her songs
and her comments, she discusses issues such as gender identities, political
authoritarianism, religious dogmatism, feudalistic systems, and female
submission and male machismo. Hadad’s performance follows a narrative
through the story of Rumberta, who starts as an innocent provincial woman
who breaks with the patriarchal traditions and travels alone to Mexico
City, where finally she decides to live her life in her own terms. It is
specially compelling the alternation and juxtaposition of contradictory
discourses on her body and her voice, given that she enacts both male and
female characters. At the end, her famous mustache is a prop that suggests
that gender is nothing but a construction.

bien pagada,’ performed at the Community Center of La Victoria, as part
of the VII Theater Festival of Bogota in 2000, offers an initial footage of
the audience before entering to see the show, to grasp an idea of the
importance and magnitude of this event. A mobile camera allows a
perspective similar to the attendants to the show, where Hadad’s voice
and presence are at the heart of the stage. In this performance, Hadad
critiques the violence against women, and speaks about the similarities
between Mexico and Colombia, advocating for a broader, Latin American
understanding of female sexuality.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] This video documentation of Astrid Hadad’s performance ‘La
bien pagada,’ performed at the Community Center of La Victoria, as part
of the VII Theater Festival of Bogota in 2000, offers an initial footage of
the audience before entering to see the show, to grasp an idea of the
importance and magnitude of this event. A mobile camera allows a
perspective similar to the attendants to the show, where Hadad’s voice
and presence are at the heart of the stage. In this performance, Hadad
critiques the violence against women, and speaks about the similarities
between Mexico and Colombia, advocating for a broader, Latin American
understanding of female sexuality.
[BIO] Astrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico.  Her
work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy
Nopal.’  The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus
distilled to make tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of
performance.  Her shows follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad
dazzles her audience with stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She
appropriates iconic images in Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and
walks onstage to reconfigure their meanings.  Through her voice and her
body, Hadad challenges to her audience to adopt her system of cultural
processing. Most of her work challenges cultural norms pertaining to gender
roles in Mexican society. She also addresses issues of US neo imperialism. 
Hadad writes, produces, and promotes her own work.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] This awarded video clip, produced independently, offers a
particular reading of Astrid Hadad’s aesthetic proposal through the song
‘Corazón sangrante.’ The video clip immerses itself in the colors,
sounds, and moving images of Adelitas and virgins. Hadad’s body and voice
are at the center of this imagery, contrasting with landscapes that suggest
links between the female body and the Mexican political body. At the same
time, the multiplied presence of Astrid Hadad suggests that identities
related to gender, sexuality, and politics are not static but mobile and
complex. 
[BIO] Astrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico.  Her
work as a solo performance artist took off in 1995 with her show ‘Heavy
Nopal.’  The term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSES] This video documentation shows a selection of Astrid Hadad and
Los Tarzanes’ songs. In ‘Heavy Nopal,’ Astrid uses Mexican iconic
references, like the cactus, the rock, the pyramid, and the tequila bottle.
These elements are not just scenery, but they appear also on Hadad’s own
body, which so becomes a human, mobile stage, and also an altar. From the
calla lilies to the extremely complex surprise-multi-purpose outfits, to
the innumerable ornaments, ‘rebozos,’ virgins of Guadalupe, guns, and
common places in the essence of Mexico, Astrid Hadad and her Tarzanes
transport the audience through several levels of iconography. Through this
iconography, Hadad offers different meanings for both the female body and
the Mexican political body. 
[BIO] Astrid Hadad is a vocalist and performance artist from Mexico. The
term ‘heavy nopal’ refers to the Mexican cactus distilled to make
tequila and is how Hadad describes her style of performance.  Her shows
follow the format of a cabaret, in which Hadad dazzles her audience with
stunning vocals and elaborated costumes. She appropriates iconic images in
Mexican culture, straps them to her body, and walks onstage to reconfigure

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In this interview, conducted by Marcial Godoy-Anativia,
associated director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics, Moysés Zúñiga Santiago talks about his photo exhibit presented
in NYC in 2010. His photos portrayed the conflict in Mitzitón, located
near to San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas. Zúñiga explains the
political and religious confrontation, as well as the presence of the
Zapatismo in this zone. He also speaks about the role of the
photojournalist, which must aim for social denounce – given the silence
of the mainstream media – in spite of the danger that it involves.
Finally, he discusses recent events in Mexican history, and he comments how
his recent visit to New York City provoked reflections about life in the
streets, and the social, linguistic, and racial contrasts that he noticed.


[BIO] A native of San Cristobal de Las Casas, Moysés Zuñiga Santiago
began his study of science and technology at the University of Xalapa in
Veracruz in 1998 where he worked in television, photography and radio. In
2003, he began work in Xalapa at Diario AZ as a photojournalist and was
subsequently hired by Milenio de Veracruz as the photography editor. 
Beginning in January of 2006 he served as the correspondent for Mexican
photography agency Cuartoscuro during Subcomandante Marcos’ ‘Other
Campaign’ and traveled the entirety of Mexico with Marcos. During this
time, Zúñiga also worked with the Associated Press (AP), EFE (Spain), and
Agence France Press (AFP). Since 2007, Zúñiga has worked with La Jornada
in San Cristóbal de Las Casas and covers the Chiapas region for the
Associated Press and EFE. In 2009 he received a Rory Peck Training Fund
grant for freelance journalists in high-risk areas from the Rory Peck
Trust.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
     [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of Regina José Galindo’s
artist talk ‘Experiences,’ presented in the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics. Galindo offered a retrospective of her
performance art work, from 1999 to the present, speaking about pieces of
art that she links with vital experiences: ‘I have experiences with
life’s episodes. I don’t know if these are sad or not. They are simply
experiences, and these have shaped me. They have been the fountain of my
wisdom, the fountain of what I can speak, of that I know.’ Galindo
presents her body as a site of conflict and violence; the painful
interventions on her own body are metaphors of different modes of class,
gender, and political violence. Her experiences are a source of knowledge
and memory, transformed into new images and actions – the basis of what
she calls ‘art products.’ 
[BIO] Regina José Galindo was born in Guatemala City. Her work has been
included in shows in diverse international venues, such as Venice-Istanbul,
Museum of Modern Art, Istanbul; Into Me, Out of Me, P.S.1, New York, and
Kunst-Werke Berlin; MASH, Miami; Las Fronteras del Género, Zaragoza,
Spain; Estrecho Dudoso, Teorética, Costa Rica; MENS mankind, S.M.A.K.,
Belgium; Courants Alternatifs, PARVIS, Paris and Bordeaux, France; and
Eretica, Palermo, Italy. She has been invited to participate in the Moscu
Biennal 2007; I Bienal Arquitectura, Arte Paisaje Islas Canarias in 2006;
III Biennale of Tirana, Albania in 2005; Venice Biennal in 2001 and 2005;
II Biennal in Prague in 2005; and III Biennal in Lima, Peru in 2002. She
won the Golden Lion Award for young artists for her participation in the
Venice Biennal in 2005. Part of her work speaks about the history of
socio-political violence in her native country of Guatemala; she also
addresses economic and political contradictions and inequalities widespread
in the Global South.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In this introduction to the 30-years celebration of the first
public CADA’s ‘acción,’ Diamela Eltit reads a text in which she
highlights the political relevance of this collective in relationship with
the Chilean dictatorship, and the hegemonic cultural domination against
which CADA performed. CADA’s ‘acciones de arte’ functioned as an
archive and artwork simultaneously. Their members wanted to make a
strategic material from the excerpt; in this sense, their methodology is
based on a fragmented reality, and heterogeneity. The well-known
intervention ‘NO +’ was the opening to a rebel narrative, and also
opened a space for the word from the streets, repressed by terror. In CADA,
arts, politics, and poetics converge, and its legacy belongs to the city
and the citizens. ‘NO +’ is now an artifact and grammar of the public
domain.
[BIO] Diamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist
and cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other
awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de
Acciones de Arte (CADA) during the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, and
has been an important cultural presence during the years of the
post-dictatorship through her participation in journals such as Revista de
Crítica Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work has made
important contributions to feminist theory and she has been a regular
contributor to Debate Feminista. In 2000, she published ‘Emergencias:
Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,’ a book of essays which
brings together some of her literary and cultural criticism.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Rossana Reguillo, conducted by Diana Taylor,
founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics.
In this interview, Professor Reguillo speaks about how fear, interplaying
with other emotions like anger and hope, is structurally used by different
governments to shape politics of passions. She maps recent historical
events to analyze how state authorities control fears and hopes of citizens
all over the Americas. She also analyzes the conflict between the Mexican
government and the ‘narco’ criminal culture as the site where politics
of passions strongly emerge. For her, these convulse relationships function
as machines that produce uncertainties – the basis for political
emotions. Examples such as the events of September 11 illustrate how fear
and anger are attributed to certain subjects, who become the ‘monsters’
to be punished. Toward the end of the interview, Professor Reguillo speaks
about current civil society movements of resistance, such as Occupy Wall
Street, as new expressions of political passions, and the role of young
citizens as the main actors for political participation.

    Video documentation of Jesusa Rodríguez’ interpretation of Sor Juana
Inés de al Cruz’ poem ‘Primero sueño,’ performed at Centro

Rodríguez performs excerpts of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’ 17th century
poem, ‘Primero Sueño,’ which the poet confesses was the only poem she
ever wrote for pleasure and for herself. As the performer strips away the
levels of the poem, she also strips away her clothes, bringing together
words and body. Jesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s leading cabaret and
political performance artist, who ran the famous El Hábito in Mexico City
with her wife Liliana Felipe. She is the recipient of an Obie Award and the
first artist named Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Video documentation of ‘La Bruja Monja’ (‘The Demon’s
Nun’), followed by Q&A, performed during the 4th Encuentro of the
Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, celebrated in July of
2003 in New York, United States, under the title ‘Spectacles of
Religiosities.’ ‘The Demon’s Nun’ is a piece by two Mayan
playwrights, Petrona de la Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinoza, who are also
founder and current members of FOMMA, a women’s collective in San
Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas. The protagonist is a woman named Domitila
whose husband, a drinker and a lecher, complains that she never wants to
have sex; instead, she directs her erotic longings toward the divine: a
luminous angel who appears in her dreams, and the santitos or small statues
of saints to whom she prays. The Demon’s Nun offers a humorous view of
very serious issues—violence against women, limited educational
opportunities, alcoholism, and abuse by priests.
[BIO] Petrona de la Cruz and Isabel Juárez Espinosa are Mayan Indian
playwrights and actresses from Chiapas, Mexico. Pioneers in theatre and
social justice in their country, in 1994 they formed the women’s
cooperative FOMMA, to empower displaced Indian women and children through
workshops in bilingual education (Tzotzil/Tzeltal and Spanish) health
programs, job skills and theatre. They have performed in small communities
throughout Chiapas as well as at universities and festivals abroad. Forced
to leave their native villages at an early age, they became maids in the
neighboring mestizo city of San Cristóbal de las Casas. In the 1980s they
went to work at the fledging Indian writers' cooperative, Sna Jtz'bajom. It
was there they became interested in theatre and received training from
Ralph Lee of the Metawee River Theatre Company. They have subsequently
worked with several other teachers including Amy Trompetter and Luis de
Tavira.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    FOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use
theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San
Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights,
and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally,
performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy,
cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and
Tzotzil indigenous languages. 'El Dueño de las Mariposas' (‘Owner o the
Butterflies’) tells the story of Chepe, an orphan predestined by his
'wayjel' - the hummingbird - to change the fate of the slaves suffering
under the despotic regime of coffee plantation landowner Don Martín
Contreras. The play exposes the despicable living and working conditions of
the coffee workers, denouncing the violation of their human rights and
demanding that the fundamental rights of these individuals be upheld. This
piece is the result of a process of collective creation on the relationship
between politics and the body; the resulting performance brings together
symbols, characters and circumstances from the rich Mayan imaginary as well
as from the everyday life conditions of indigenous peoples in Latin
America, in intricate labyrinths of time, love, injustice, and freedom, an
urgent call for inalienable human rights.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    FOMMA - Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya - is a collective of Mayan women who use
theater as a tool for education and community building. Based in San
Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, they are performers, playwrights,
and teachers who tour their work in their communities and internationally,
performing plays that focus on women's and indigenous rights, literacy,
cultural survival, ecology, health, and education in the Tzeltal and
Tzotzil indigenous languages. ‘Buscando nuevos caminos’ (‘Looking for
New Paths’) is a play about about the false promises that impulse
indigenous men and women to find new opportunities in the United States.
The forced separation due to migration leaves women by themselves, in a
society where they have to learn to survive the violence and greed of
unscrupulous relatives. When three young women decide to go to the North
and cross the border to find their parents, they have to suffer the abuse
of the ‘coyote’ and the difficult conditions of the desert. Trying to
escape from the dangers in the border, families get separated, as many
fractured families due to migration and violence. The women of FOMMA offer
strong monologues about the desire of crossing the border – they measure
the reasons to leave, but most importantly, the reasons to stay in Chiapas.
They end the play with a firm ‘I’m going to live here, and I’m going
to die here’ calling their brothers and sisters to come back home and
look for new paths in their own land. Q&A with the members of FOMMA follow
this performance’s video documentation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] ‘The Fury of the Gods’ is an exercise in Pop Blasphemy, and
an ecclesiastical experiment in Heathenism. It is a sharp biting satire
that skewers the sacred and eviscerated evangelical fundamentalism
suggesting that it may be the principal obstacle that stands in the way to
intercultural understanding, creating a rhetoric of the state in order to
justify segregation and oppression. Written and performed by Susana Cook,
‘The Fury of the Gods’ is a series of ecclesiastical interventions that
mocks capitalist individualism with a humoristic self-criticism, playing
with the idea that evangelical fundamentalism might have mistaken where
‘heaven’ can be found. Susana Cook uses religious oratory to highlight
conservative interpretations of homosexuality and exaggerate them, taking
them to their logical extremes. As conservative narrative appropriates
religion to fulfill an agenda, Cook's work appropriates religious and
political language as a means to unveil the ways that fundamentalist belief
have come to influence public policy and unmask the real substance and
immorality of these national messages.

director. She has presented her work as an independent artist for over 20

with the idea that evangelical fundamentalism might have mistaken where
‘heaven’ can be found. In this video documentation of ‘The Fury of
the Gods’ second iteration at The Charm City Kitty Club in Baltimore, it
can be observed how words and body perform in different manners, and how an
artistic show is never experienced in the same way. Developing an amazing
relationship with her audience, Susana Cook uses religious oratory to
highlight conservative interpretations of homosexuality and exaggerate
them, taking them to their logical extremes. As conservative narrative
appropriates religion to fulfill an agenda, Cook's work appropriates
religious and political language as a means to unveil the ways that
fundamentalist belief have come to influence public policy and unmask the

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of Barbi Bermúdez and Fabi
Fernández’s TV show ‘Tercer Impacto,’ performed live at El Museo del
Barrio. Barbi and Fabi share the stage with 158-years-old Doña Cuca, whose
longevity has inspired Western medicine to develop the amazing health
supplement ‘Hispanacea.’ Doña Cuca opens her shopping trolley, full of
US patriotism’s treasures, to have a ‘tea party’… although perhaps
a ‘cafecito negro cola’o’ would be tastier for these Latinas.
[BIO] Fulana is a video and performance collective created in 2000 by four
Latinas in New York City (Cristina Ibarra, Marlène Ramírez-Cancio,
Lisandra Ramos-Grullón & Andrea Thome). Using parody and satire, their
work delves into topics affecting the Latino communities in the U.S., and
responds to the ways products and ideas are marketed and sold to us through
the mass media.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Guillermo Gómez-Peña’s Border Brujo stopped by NYC to share
his spoken word’s enchantments. Always at the center of discussions about
US anti-immigration policies, Fulana’s Fabi Fernández opens the show
reading the impossible instructions to apply for a visa to the US, while
Guillermo Gómez-Peña reminds to whomever it might concern that ‘we are
here precisely because you were there.’ Gómez-Peña exposes the
contradictions of US anti immigration and anti Spanish language enforcement
with his well-known linguistic mix that jumps from Spanish to English,
Spanglish, and unknown tongues,. He also generously offers a Spanish lesson
for gringo friends who have to work with Latinos (with Barbi and Fabi’s
help) addressing the ups and downs of ‘intercultural’ relations.
Moreover, in this particular occasion, Gómez-Peña’s persona deals with
the coming of years, his fear of loosing his Chicano mojo, and his sexual
pathologies with a computer. Between eroticism and imaginary political
speeches, 'GGP' shows the power of spoken word, the power of performance
art, and how great it feels to imagine. 

[BIO] Guillermo Gómez-Peña is a performance artist/writer and the
director of the transnational arts collective La Pocha Nostra. He was born
in Mexico City and came to the US in 1978. Since then he has been exploring
cross-cultural issues with the use of performance, multilingual poetry,
journalism, video, radio, and installation art. His performance work and
eight books have contributed to the debates on cultural diversity,
identity, and US-Mexico relations. His artwork has been presented at over
seven hundred venues across the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia
and Australia. He is a MacArthur Fellow, American Book Award winner, and a
Senior Fellow of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. He
is a regular contributor to National Public Radio, a writer for newspapers
and magazines in the US, Mexico, and Europe, and a contributing editor to
The Drama Review (NYU-MIT).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Peggy Shaw performs excerpts from her show ‘Must: The Inside
Story,’ a collaboration with Clod Ensemble, London. Conceived as ‘a
journey through the shadows of a city, a pound of flesh, a book of
love…,’ this piece generates a space of shared and communal affects,
such as sadness and fear, but also hope. In the pre-show, Peggy Shaw
welcomes the people and leads them into the space, setting the scene for a
show that is more an act of sharing – a one-woman show that,
paradoxically, is communal. Peggy Shaw’s voice, by both speaking and
singing, performs as a source of emotions that are invoked to act as a
means of healing. She offers a cartography of her body, a body that can
become dust at some point, but that is always leaving a trace of memories.
Challenging medical language, ‘The Inside Story” is a way to show
internal emotions attached to the body, which are intensified with the
presence of a sense of lost. An intimate session of Q&A with the artist
follows this video documentation of the performance.

[BIO] Peggy Shaw (www.splitbritches.com) is an independent performance
artist, painter and poet who believes in new images, and rejects old ideas.
She challenges established practices in theatre, prisons, gender,
relationships and humor. Her work is firmly rooted in a queer feminist
perspective, with an unceasing quest for global equality in writing, spoken
word and performance.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Diamela Eltit, conducted by Diana Taylor,
founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics.
This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute,
articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series
aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of
defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a
lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied
behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on
the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned
figures in contemporary performance studies and practice. 

[BIO] Diamela Eltit is a distinguished Chilean performance artist, novelist
and cultural critic. Winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous other
awards and appointments, Eltit was a member of the acclaimed Colectivo de
Acciones de Arte (CADA), a Chilean activist group of artists who used
performance to challenge Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. She has been an
important cultural presence during the years of the post-dictatorship
through her participation in journals such as the Revista de Crítica
Cultural. Both as an artist and a critic, Eltit's work constitutes an
important contribution to feminist theory and cultural debates. In 2000,
she published 'Emergencias: Escritos sobre literatura, arte y política,' a
book of essays which brings together some of her literary and cultural
criticism. Her narrative work includes 'Lumpérica' (1983), 'Por la patria'
(1986), 'El padre mío' (1989), 'El infarto del alma' (with photographer
Paz Errázuriz [1994]), 'Mano de obra' (2002), 'Jamás el fuego nunca'
(2007), and most recently 'Impuesto a la carne' (2010). Both individually
and as a member of CADA, Diamela Eltit was one of the most important
contributors to the 'Escena de Avanzada.' Eltit has also held positions as
writer-in-residence at Brown University, Washington University in St.
Louis, Columbia University, UC/Berkeley the University of Virginia,
Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University. She is currently the
Distinguished Global Professor of Creative Writing in Spanish at
NYU.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Interview with David Lozano, conducted by Marlène
Ramírez-Cancio, Associate Director of Arts & Media at the Hemispheric
Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, David Lozano
discusses the role of the body in the intertwining dynamics between arts
and politics. Lozano’s performance work explores the relational links
between bodies, proposing powerful ways for evidencing and undoing embodied
constructions of gender and citizenship. Considering performance as a site
for surprise, and for the non-controlled, his work ‘Marca y ego: Oficios
para el cuerpo’ offers a reflection upon how bodies are marked as
‘abjected,’ and how those bodies’ textures are a surface that
transmits meaning. Although the body is a vulnerable territory, it also can
function as a means to subvert preconceptions about the body, within the
body, and from the body.     

[BIO] David Lozano is a visual artist with a specialization in painting. He
has a Masters degree in Visual and Fine Arts from the Universidad Nacional
de Colombia. He teaches at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,
Universidad de los Andes, Santo Tomás de Aquino and the Academy of
Superior Arts of Bogotá. Currently he is a teacher and the director of the
School of Visual Arts at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. As an
artist, his work has focused on the investigation of the postmodern and
globalized body.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] ‘El gran teatro del mundo’ is an ‘auto sacramental’
written by Spanish playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca in the 17th
century to allegorically convey catholic values. Proposing that the world
is a large stage, the play states that human beings have to play a role and
make decisions with virtue and wisdom, because rewards or punishment will
come in the after life. Luis Peirano rescued the powerful spectacularity of
this play to offer an eclectic reading of it according with the complex
Peruvian context at the beginning of the 21st century. The display of
actors, performers, dancers, acrobats, and singers transforms this piece
into a ‘fiesta’ that celebrates traditions, and that revisits the
‘mestizaje’ between Spanish and Peruvian cultures and traditions from a
productive perspective. This play, which had more than 500 performers on
stage, is not only a precious rereading of what ‘spectacles of
religiosities’ are, but also is an example of the complicated
relationship existing between religious and politics in Peru. Given that
the original pedagogic intention of the text played a secondary role in
Peirano’s version, the authorities of the Peruvian Catholic Church denied
their permission for the play to be staged in the Lima cathedral’s atrium
– a central space for ‘autos sacramentales.’ In spite of this denial,
and perhaps because of it, the group of artists who worked in this piece,
lead by Peirano, decided to keep presenting it for several years in other
venues. This insistence on keep staging a play that became meaningful as an
affirmation of creative independence is still remembered in Lima as a
strong and valuable political gesture, and a reminder of the power of
performance to mobilize affects and thought. 

[BIO] Luis Peirano received his PhD in the humanities from the Pontificia
Universidad Católica del Perú and his master’s in Communication Arts
from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is a sociologist who focuses
on communication and culture, and also works as a theatrical director. He
was the founder and first dean of the Faculty of Sciences and Arts in
Communication at Peru’s Catholic University and also developed the
master’s program in communications there. He is a member of the Ethics
Board for the Peruvian press and served as its president from 2006 to 2007.
He is also a member of the National Cultural Commission and of the Advisory
Technical Commission of UNESCO. In 2011, Luis Peirano was appointed as
Minister of Culture by the Peruvian government.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of Julieta Paredes’
talk/performance/no-performance entitled ‘Hilando fino desde el feminismo
comunitario,’ presented as part of the CLACS Research Colloquium Series
‘Decolonization in the Andes: Contemporary Debates and Trasnformations,’
co-organized by the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics and
the Department of Performance Studies at NYU. Julieta Paredes stages a
transformation during her presentation, changing from her Westernized
clothes to her grandmother’s clothes, and so visibly turning into an
indigenous woman, or ‘chola.’ Paredes claims that, in Bolivia,
‘nobody looks at me when I’m dressing as a chola: we become
invisible.’ Stating also that ‘cholas don’t have a body, don’t have
a sexuality, don’t have ideas,’ Paredes’s proposes to engage in
political participation with and from her body. She insists in that which
she is doing ‘is not a performance,’ but an actual transmission of her
sisters and her people’s thoughts and demands through her voice and her
body. In this manner, Paredes brings to presence the very topics she is
discussing – being that women’s corporeality has been at the center of
colonial penetration, she proposes that resistance and contestation against
colonialism must come from those feminine bodies. Thus, the task of
recovering women’s corporeality and sexuality is at the basis of her
proposal of ‘communal feminism’ is. This is the first step to achieve
balance between brothers and sisters, and start working side by side to
regain native communities’ sovereignty. 


[BIO]  Julieta Paredes Carvajal is an Aymara lesbian and communitarian
feminist. She was a founding member of ‘Mujeres Creando’ (Women
Creating), and she worked with this collective for many years. She is
also founder of 'Mujeres creando comunidad' (Women Creating
Community), and of the Assembly of Communitarian Feminism. She lives
in in La Paz, Bolivia, a place where a hope-inspiring political
process is currently taking place. She is a writer, singer and
anti-patriarchal poet.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Julieta Paredes, conducted by Marcial
Godoy-Anativia, Associate Director of the Hemispheric Institute of
Performance and Politics. In this interview, Julieta Paredes underlines the
centrality of a communal spirit in her work, stating that when she speaks,
her voice is a resonance of the voice of her ‘compañeras.’ She
questions Western notions of what ‘performance’ is, claiming that the
‘Pachamama’ (Mother Earth) has taught her and her people a cultural
performance or ‘performance del pueblo.’ She also points out that the
use of the term ‘performance’ might tend to highlight an aesthetic or
artistic practice, which can imply a depoliticization of the contents
transmitted through actions. Paredes explains how she envisions indigenous
people’s communal work, working together from their bodies and
sexualities, building what she calls ‘communal feminism.’ Thus, from
the particularities of traditional indigenous communities, an active
political participation in the public sphere can be set in motion. She also
talks about the ‘acciones’ of ‘Mujeres Creando’ and later
‘Mujeres Creando Comunidad,’ which are created to engage with people in
public spaces, and to communicate and transmit those social and political
struggles that have been invisibilized and silenced.

[BIO]  Julieta Paredes Carvajal is an Aymara lesbian and communitarian
feminist. She was a founding member of ‘Mujeres Creando’ (Women
Creating), and she worked with this collective for many years. She is
also founder of 'Mujeres creando comunidad' (Women Creating
Community), and of the Assembly of Communitarian Feminism. She lives
in in La Paz, Bolivia, a place where a hope-inspiring political
process is currently taking place. She is a writer, singer and
anti-patriarchal poet.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed in a
public square in La Paz, Bolivia. Using a blood-colored liquid and the
presence of young women, Mujeres Creando invites the passers-by to reflect
upon the lives lost in the constant struggle for political power, and
reminds them that women are one of the main victims of a political system
that allows institutional gendered violence. Questioning the functionality
of the President as representative of Bolivian people, this acción
suggests that repression is not exclusive of dictatorships, and that
democracy also exerts oppression through unequal gender politics. The
intervention of the police in order to stop the acción illustrates how
Mujeres Creando’s work brings together performance and activism.

[BIO] Mujeres Creando is an autonomous feminist movement created in 1992 in
La Paz, Bolivia. It is comprised of women of different cultural, social,
and ethereal origins, and approaches creativity as an instrument of
resistance and social participation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed in a
public square in La Paz, Bolivia. Mujeres Creando’s proposal considers
that ‘the street is the space where we make sense, where be become full
of meaning;’ thus, the streets are the most important stage to perform
political gestures and to enact political actions. Through the simple but
powerful act of setting a dining table in the middle of the streets,
Mujeres Creando bring together the private and the public, and reconfigure
the structures of power that constrain people’s freedom. The acción of
sharing food with the passers-by not only addresses the fact that we all
are equals and part of the same society, but also invites to remember that
sharing communal activities is an act of love.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed
inside of a State Judiciary building in La Paz, Bolivia. Mujeres Creando
filled the building’s hall with pieces of paper, to demand an actual and
functional justice for all the cases of rape and murders against women.
Considering that the notion of ‘justice’ seems to be reduced to
meaningless paperwork that does not solve anything, Mujeres Creando claim
that ‘justice’ in Bolivia is bought by privileges of class and race,
and that there is no justice for the dispossessed. Through the acción of
disrupting the building’s routine, and through the use of voices and
singing, Mujeres Creando bring the voices of women who have not received
justice.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed at
the entrance of a mall in La Paz, Bolivia. When women dressed in
traditional indigenous Aymara clothing approach to white women to offer
them Mujeres Creando’s pink ribbons, some of those women do not know how
to react – some of them think that the indigenous women are selling
something, or begging, and some of them ignore their indigenous peers.
Collecting opinions of the mall’s female costumers, it is clear that some
of them even question the fact that indigenous women can be at the door of
the mall, ‘invading their space,’ where they should not be allowed. On
the other side, the indigenous women who participate in the acción mention
that they sensed that some women felt repulsion against them. With this
acción, Mujeres Creando exposed the racism that exists between women of
the same country. This exposure of racism against indigenous people brings
to the fore a question about visibility, and what people choose to see. By
going to the mall in their indigenous clothes, or ‘chola clothes,’
Mujeres Creando highlights the fact that racism is also embodied in a
specific way of dressing, and that ‘dressing like a chola’ is an act of
political transvestism, a gesture that demands us to see that which has
been invisibilized.  

[BIO] Mujeres Creando is an autonomous feminist movement created in 1992 in
La Paz, Bolivia. It is comprised of women of different cultural, social,
and ethereal origins, and approaches creativity as an instrument of
resistance and social participation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed in
the streets of La Paz, Bolivia. Two women walk carrying a mirror and Barbie
dolls, inviting women to question the beauty patterns imposed by a
patriarchal and neo-colonial society. At the public square, a group of
women struggle with the mirrors, the Barbie dolls, and colored ribbons that
tie and constrain them. Finally, they free themselves from the ribbons and
the mirrors. With this acción, Mujeres Creando criticize the beauty
patterns imposed upon women, and the social expectations that make women
fight against women; they also question the racism embedded in Bolivian
society, where indigenous women don’t recognize themselves in the white
skin and blond hair of the ‘model’ of feminine beauty.

[BIO] Mujeres Creando is an autonomous feminist movement created in 1992 in
La Paz, Bolivia. It is comprised of women of different cultural, social,
and ethereal origins, and approaches creativity as an instrument of
resistance and social participation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of two ‘acciones’ performed
in-between the realms of the private and the public in La Paz, Bolivia. In
the first part, an indigenous woman speaks while she undoes her braids and
brushes her hair. She speaks about her sexuality, and claims that she is
‘una chola diferente, una chola libre’ (‘a different chola, a free
chola’). In the second part, Julieta Paredes and María Galindo, two of
the founding members of Mujeres Creando, draw a red heart at the center of
the public square, and after offering flowers to the passers-by, they set a
bed in the middle of the painted heart, lay down together, hold hands, and
kiss each other. With these acciones, Mujeres Creando point out how gender
and body politics constrain even the more intimate relationships, and how
anti-lesbianism is strongly rooted in a patriarchal society. Bringing
lesbian love to a public space and talking about sexuality aloud are
vehement political gestures of rebellion and resistance.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of two ‘acciones’ performed to
reclaim sovereignty in the political decisions taken by native communities
in Bolivia. In the first part, a young woman’s speech ironically
reinstates what is socially expected from women, at the same time that it
suggests the possibility of building a non-profit organization lead by
local women. In the second part, Mujeres Creando propose a strong criticism
against international NGOs, questioning the paternalism of organizations
lead by people who see indigenous communities as exotic. They also critique
some NGOs’ corruption with regards international donations, and point out
the race and gender issues involved in cultural imperialism.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of an ‘acción’ performed in a
public square in La Paz, Bolivia. Working with the universally consumed
product from the Andes, a group of women peel potatoes, while they talk
about their desire for equal opportunity of work for women and men, and
better conditions for jobs that could also feed their dreams and hopes. In
this acción, Mujeres Creando worked in collaboration with a group of men,
who start washing clothes and peeling potatoes side by side with women.
Finally, all together create the word ‘felicidad’ (‘happiness’)
with potatoes painted in red, ending the acción with a product of a
collaborative effort.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] Based in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz
was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language
of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created
a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on
the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de
Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school,
offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal
organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the
creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui
Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality,
and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge
and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world
marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and
barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce
injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of
memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of
arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics
and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle
for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in
it.

[SYNOPSIS] 'Widows, Performance about Absence' is part of the continuing
theater research the Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz has been
undertaking on the imagery and recent history of Latin America. Using Ariel
Dorfman and Tony Kushner’s Widows as a starting point, the Tribe
continues its investigation into the ritual scene, within the trajectory of
Teatro de Vivência (experiential theater). 'Widows' features women who
fight for the right of knowing where are the men who were disappeared or
killed by the military dictatorship that the country went through. It is an
allegory about the events that took place in the last decades in Latin
America, and the need to keep the memory of this time of horror alive, so
that it does not repeat itself. Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz’ Teatro de
Vivência strives for an open and sincere relationship with the audience,
in which actors and spectators share a common experience with the intensity
of a unique event, capable of producing new modes of perception.

[SYNOPSIS] 'O amargo santo da purificação — Uma visão alegórica e
barroca da vida, paixão e morte do revolucionário Carlos Marighella,' a
collective creation for Street Theater, tells the story of a popular hero
whom the dominant sectors tried to banish from the national landscape for
decades. Scene after scene, the audience witnesses important moments of
this trajectory: his origins in Bahia, his youth, his poetry, the
dictatorship of the Estado Novo, the resistance, his imprisonment, the
democracy, the constitutional assembly, his life in the underground, the
Military Dictatorship, the armed resistance, his death in an ambush, and
the recovery of this history, striving for a human portrait of Twentieth
Century Brazil. It’s a story of courage and boldness, perseverance and
tenaciousness in ones convictions, and the coherence of socialist ideals
throughout a generous and combative life, end to end. Marighella never
abdicated his right to dream of a world free of oppression. He lived,
fought, and died for this dream.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a
vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of
multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting
demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD
Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point
on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a
site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx,
and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western
Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied
the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists
were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches,
methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is
Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with
people of the future — youth, in equal collaboration with artists and
scholars.

[SYNOPSIS] ‘Do Lord Remember Me,’ directed by Roberta Uno, focuses on
the memories of former slaves in Virginia. John De Jongh’s play was the
perfect vehicle to bring together theater and music, with the collaboration
of UMASS music professor Horace Boyer, and the participation of cast
members from the community in Amherst. The memories of ex-slaves recorded
in interviews in the 1930’s constitute the raw material of this theater
piece. The lines and dialogue of this play are the words of black men and
women in their eighties and nineties, who remember their experience of the
‘peculiar institution’ as it happened to them nearly a lifetime ago.
Characters in the play adopt different personalities, telling the
stories/histories of other slaves’ experiences, and expressing the
oppressions of serving in the military, inter-racial relationships, and the
black/white social power dynamic. Among these horrors, faith sustained them
and infused their desire for survival, always holding the promise that in
the future they will be free: ‘On my way to heaven, Lord remember me …
do Lord, do Lord, do Lord remember me.’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a
vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of
multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting
demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD
Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point
on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a
site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx,
and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western
Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied
the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists
were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches,
methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is
Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with
people of the future — youth, in equal collaboration with artists and
scholars.

 [SYNOPSIS] Stephen Newby composed and conducted the Vocal Jazz and
Afroamerican Ensemble in the gospel/jazz oratorio ‘Be Still and Know.’
With the direction of Roberta Uno, this performance stages the space of the
church, and the choir’s voices, as site for political discussion on
identity matters, given that the multicultural and multiracial ensemble
melts musically in harmony. The chorus ‘Be still and know that I am
God,’ is not only a calling on people and children to put their faith and
trust in God, but mostly an invitation to learning and sharing through
voices, music, and sound.

 [SYNOPSIS] This is a promotional video featuring performers from the play
‘Miss Ida B. Wells,’ written by Endesha Ida Mae Holland, and directed
by Roberta Uno.  The performers discuss Ida B. Well’s political
involvement with anti-slavery activism.  They state that the purpose of the
play is to bring light and attention to Ida B. Well’s political work. 
Roberta Uno points out how the play generates discussion around political
issues, and she also talks about how New WORLD Theater is a social stage
that brings theater to communities, and functions as an open cultural
platform for theater artist of color.  The artists involved in this
performance believe that Miss Ida B. Wells educates audience members and
gives them a better understanding of cultural diversity.

 [SYNOPSIS] ‘Sheila’s Day,’ written by Duma Ndlovu, and directed by
Roberta Uno, explores the troubled race relations between white employers
and black domestic employees, and the many layers within structures of
power – ‘Sheila’ is the name that the rich ladies use to call their
household employees, because they claim that they cannot remember the
women’s names. Every Thursday is ‘Sheila’s Day,’ when the domestic
workers have a day off, and the women come to meet with each other. During
these meetings, it is possible to learn these women’s desires and hopes,
and their belief that ‘women have the power to change the world.’ They
empower themselves through music and songs that function as oral history
and political language, and their dance as a means of communication and
political resistance, conveying a strong affirmation of being a ‘woman’
and ‘black,’ thus a ‘black woman.’ They find strength through each
other in their collective struggle for freedom - song, dance, and prayer
play an important part in their bonding with one another, and this
closeness is performed through voices and bodies. This video documentation
also features pre-performance exercises.

 [SYNOPSIS] ‘Flying West,’ written by Pearl Cleage and directed by
Roberta Uno, is the story of a small group of African-American women whose
lives changed when they decide to go to the West and settle in a new, rough
region. In this encounter with a new environment, themes such as
determination, racism, interracial marriage, feminism, pride, and freedom
arise to offer a reflection upon how individuals, families, and communities
survive together. Among the difficulties of everyday life, there is power
in the fact of being able of knowing who we are and where we go, as the
women in the play affirm their identity as ‘three Negro women.’ The
sisters Sophie, Fannie, and Minnie, and their neighbor Miss Leah, have to
empower each other, especially when Minnie suffers domestic violence from
her husband. When the couple’s abusive relationship becomes more and more
violent, and when this violence threatens all the women’s well-being,
they have to decide how to maintain their freedom and their sisterhood.
This video documentation also features a pre-performance discussion with
the cast.

[SYNOPSIS] ‘R.A.W. (‘Cause I’m a Woman) is a short play written by
Diana Son and directed by Roberta Uno. R.A.W. stands for ‘Raunchy Asian
Woman,’ as the play intends to explore stereotypes about Asian woman,
such as that of the geisha, the exotic virgin, or the suicidal Miss Saigon.
 An all Asian American women cast perform dance, music, and spoken word.
Their voices address the politics between mixed raced relationships,
specifically between Asian American women and white men; quotidian and
apparently minimal things like asian hair in relation to a white woman’s
hair; the experience of being a queer Asian woman; dating a Korean man from
the perspective of a Korean woman, etc. All the characters come on stage
and share their experiences of being Asian women in multiple shapes, forms,
and identities.

[SYNOPSIS] ‘Combination Skin,’ written by Lisa Jones and directed by
Roberta Uno, explores the racial politics that has been imposed upon black
individuals, proposing ‘Who says it's the black man’s burden to be
black.’ Taking a look to historical figures and racial stereotypes, the
conversations on stage go towards black skin tonality, discussing if
‘combination skin’ defines, or not, our own identities. Even more,
whiteness as a counterpart of black identity is brought as a desired space
for hiding the skin color that is related to negativity, and ‘dreaming of
a white life.’ Playing with irony, and acknowledging that the fears
embedded in centuries of a history of oppression are not easy to dissolve,
the characters engage within a game show scenario that announces the
winners of the whitest black person – a gesture that moves between
sarcasm and despair.

 [SYNOPSIS] In ‘Looking In/To The Future,’ the New WORLD Theater worked
with young people in the Khmer, Vietnamese, Latina/o, and African-American
communities surrounding Amherst, Massachusetts to help them define their
cultural identities through writing and theatre activities. In this
workshop final presentation, a group of young performers discuss their
social, cultural, and class backgrounds. Speaking in their many languages,
we get a glimpse into the characters’ lives in a school setting,
expressing their parents’ expectations for their future, and their
cultural legacy of the past. They also engage with games, and while
performing their ‘animal personalities,’ they reflect upon their land,
nature, and village. By the end of the play, the young performers come out
on stage and collectively state the message ‘Were going to a place where
we can make a new world.’ This video documentation features a brief Q&A
with the performers

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a
vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of
multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting
demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD
Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point
on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a
site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx,
and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western
Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied
the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists
were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches,
methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is
Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with
people of the future — youth, in equal collaboration with artists and
scholars.

[SYNOPSIS] In ‘Looking In/To The Future,’ the New WORLD Theater worked
with young people in the Khmer, Vietnamese, Latina/o, and African-American
communities surrounding Amherst, Massachusetts to help them define their
cultural identities through writing and theatre activities. In this final
presentation of a workshop, the characters discuss their hopes for the
future and their family’s expectations of themselves. Among different
cultural backgrounds, Cambodia is often referenced, and each of the
characters discusses what they want to do with their future. They have
dreams, as any kid, of being a writer, an engineer, a soccer player, or a
scientist; but they are aware their ethnic identities will be part in the
process, and that some of them can be struggling with their national
identity. By the end of the play, in spite of all their fears, the young
performers’ chant say ‘We are going, Heaven knows where we are going
... We will get there, Heaven knows how we will get there, but we know we
will.’

Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with
people of the future — youth, in equal collaboration with artists and
scholars.

[SYNOPSIS] ‘I Was Born With 2 Tongues’ was created by the New WORLD
Theater Residency, which brought young performers to explore their own
artistic voice. In this rehearsal of a slam/spoken word performance, a
group of talented young artists discusses the politics of trying to get
roles as different body-typed people, and how racial identities might be a
challenge. Moreover, their voices made us reflect upon the misogyny women
face on a daily basis; family and cultural identity; immigration, race, and
nationhood. Although all of them are difficult topics, the power of these
voices, and the energy of the performers, offer a glimpse of hope. This
video documentation features ‘In America’ by Dennis; ‘Letter to Our
Unborn Children’ by Ensemble; ‘Not your Fetish’ by Emily and Anida;
‘Race and I’m Running’ by Dennis and Marlon;‘Morning Papers’ by
Marlon; ‘Excuse Me America’ by Anida; ‘Lost and Found’ by Dennis;
and ‘Loudmouth Woman’ by Emily.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro
(www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art
installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi
Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera,
mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work
proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often
complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to
experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,'
they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that
offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media
and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along
with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real
action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on
video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice,
and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and
metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and
collaborative projects world-wide.

[SYNOPSIS] Interview with Rolf Abderhalden and Heidi Abderhalden, founders
and directors of Mapa Teatro, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director
of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. This interview is
focused on the production, organization, theoretical conceptualization, and
the experience of the project ‘Witness to the Ruins,’ created by Mapa
Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood Santa
Inés del Cartucho, Bogotá. The conversation discusses the notion of
‘archive’ propelled by this project, which has become a mobile memory
for the city. Mapa Teatro’s work subverts and questions the inflexible
coherence that an archive usually imposes to memory. During the
gentrification process of Bogotá, El Cartucho’s human side was forgotten
under the idea of urban progress; Mapa Teatro’s work intends to recover
the memories of the citizens evicted from their neighborhood, emphasizing
the role of the body as the space where remembering and forgetting become a
present experience. In this way, body and presence remove themselves from
the archive, and become the living voice of memory.

collaborative projects world-wide.

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of Mapa Teatro’s artistic
creation laboratory, with the participation of a group of former
inhabitants of the neighborhood of Santa Inés del Cartucho, between 2002
and 2003. The laboratory’s goal was to stage the first act of
‘Prometheus,’ by Heinner Muller (1929-1995), to be performed in the
vacant land left after the demolition of El Cartucho. This neighborhood was
erased during the gentrification process promoted by the Peñalosa’s
administration in 1990. This documentary shows the stories and memories of
the people evicted from their space: how they got there, how their lives
were there, how their affects and bodies were part of El Cartucho. Both
these stories and archive images from the gentrification’s years, allow
an approximation to the diverse experiences of reality before, during, and
after the demolition and extermination of this historical space.

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of the staging of ‘Prometheus,’
performed by the participants of the artistic creation laboratory lead by
Mapa Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood
Santa Inés del Cartucho, demolished during the gentrification process of
Bogota’s historic downtown. The minimal objects rescued from this erased
space, such as chairs, tables, and beds, are in contrast with the open
space of the illuminated city – an ironic horizon for stories of loss and
displacement. Both through archive images and video, the inhabitants of El
Cartucho tell their stories, individually and collectively, and the
spectators can get a glimpse of memories that remain after being removed
from a space of belonging. The video documentation of this performance
suggests the many layers involved in the process of remembering and
forgetting: the bodies of these Colombian citizens perform in a space that
is not there anymore, neither for them nor for us. In the same way that
their presence in a ghostly space activate living memories, Mapa Teatro’s
documentation project is an invitation to engage with the ongoing process
of enacting memory, and to question the guidelines imposed in the name of a
progress that intends to erase whatever it considers ‘unacceptable.’

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of the staging of ‘Prometheus,’
performed by the participants of the artistic creation laboratory lead by
Mapa Teatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood
Santa Inés del Cartucho, demolished during the gentrification process of
Bogota’s historic downtown. Along with the performance, this video offers
documentation that helps to render the totality of a complex project: the
collaborative process between neighbors of El Cartucho and Mapa Teatro,
working together in the workshop, as well as a detailed perspective of the
recollection of the participants’ memories, and the final event that was
the staging of ‘Prometheus.’ The minimal objects rescued by the
participants from this erased space, such as chairs, tables, and beds, are
in contrast with the open space of the illuminated city – an ironic
horizon for stories of loss and displacement. Both through archive images
and video, the inhabitants of El Cartucho tell their stories, individually
and collectively, and the spectators can get a glimpse of memories that
remain after being removed from a space of belonging. One of the most
emotive stories is Juana Ramirez’ – who walks through the ruins of what
sometime was her house, recollecting little objects and intense memories.
The video documentation of this performance suggests the many layers
involved in the process of remembering and forgetting: the bodies of these
Colombian citizens perform in a space that is not there anymore, neither
for them nor for us. In the same way that their presence in a ghostly space
activate living memories, Mapa Teatro’s documentation project is an
invitation to actively engage with the ongoing process of enacting memory,
and to question the guidelines imposed in the name of a progress that
intends to erase whatever it considers ‘unacceptable.’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro
(www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art
installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi
Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera,
mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation.Their work proposes
richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex
psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to
experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an 'agent of fiction,'
they describe their project as 'a laboratory of social imagination,' that
offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media
and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along
with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real
action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on
video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice,
and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and
metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and
collaborative projects world-wide.

[SYNOPSIS] This video recording broadcasts the presentation of archival
documentation of ‘Witness of the Ruins’ by the Colombian collective
Mapa Teatro as part of ‘Injured Cities: Urban Afterlives Conference,’
hosted by the Center for the Critical Analysis of Social Difference at
Columbia University. This conference, convened on the tenth anniversary of
the events of September 11, 2001, aimed to explore the effects of
catastrophe on cities and their inhabitants, to analyze the politics of
shock and terror states use in response to their vulnerability, and to
imagine more life-affirming modes of redress and re-invention. Mapa
Teatro’s performance/lecture compiles personal and group experiences
lived while working on four projects (Prometheus, Run-throughs, The
Cleaning of the Stables of Augeas, and Witness to the Ruins) inspired and
materialized during the gentrification process of the neighborhood of El
Cartucho in Bogota. The many layers of archive and memory are embodied
through the voices and bodies of Mapa Teatro’s directors, Rolf and Heidi
Abderhalden, who show a ghostly screening of the documentation that
remained after each project was created and performed, and remember the
impact that they had on the families, the spectators, and themselves. The
entire experience was possible because of the bonds established with the
inhabitants of the neighborhood as well as the interest in creating a
moving memorial monument against ‘the architecture of the emptiness.’
After presenting the fourth project, Rolf and Heidi sit down just to
witness the last archive images displaying news about the new spaces that
El Cartucho’s people are trying to occupy and the empty park built on the
territory where the neighborhood was. In a constant reactivation of the
archive, they insert themselves in the process of remembering what they do
not want to forget: the living memory of human beings that cannot be
erased. Q&A and comments by Diana Taylor and Andreas Huyssen accompany this
performance/lecture.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art. 

[SUMMARY] This is a video documentation of one of the first events created by Project 2050, ‘More Than One Prison,’ where young performers discuss the relationships between youth of color and the prison industrial complex. Performers integrate movement and rhyme, stomp style, to discuss the politics of prisons. They reflect upon prison as an omnipresent institution that affects individual lives, making people social prisoners. If imprisonment pervades so many aspects of life, then they ask: ‘how do you know you are free?’ Through spoken word and verses created by them, these young performers share with the audience their thoughts about what means being a woman, being a person of color, and being marginalized in a society that lacks opportunities. They make clear that incarceration is not the only way of being in prison, and that social change is necessary to be free of both symbolic and violent forms of oppression.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] ‘Quinceañera’ is a video documentation of a performance created collaboratively to address the 15th anniversary of the AIDS pandemic. As a collaborative creation, these stories can be read not only like personal stories, but also as the stories of a community. Alberto Antonio Araiza, Paul Bonin-Rodriguez, and Michael Marínez worked together in community-based activism, and create a multi-disciplinary performance piece that involves storytelling, ritual, performance and visual arts. For this reason, ‘Quinceañera’ transits between the cheerfulness of a creative process and the engagement with a topic that is full of fear and sorrow. The ghost of AIDS permeates relations between persons and their own traditions, stories, and histories. Particularly, the social ritual of the ‘quinceañera’ – the debutante party reserved for young girls in Spanish-speaking communities – becomes a space of contesting gender and sexuality roles. At the same time that the piece reveals how rituals are gendered, it also highlights how affective responses to pop culture can be understood as newer familiar traditions. The role of Spanish language, unapologetically spoken in the piece, underlines the fact that gender, ethnicity, and race are intertwined in social marginalization. Along with an honest and strong affirmation of race and sexuality, the virus that marks the body signals identity and belonging. The three male characters explain how AIDS affected gay population, and the discrimination that comes with the epidemic. The group of men breaks into songs advocating for justice for all people infected with AIDS, and the entire queer community. The video documentation also features a talk back with the performers and the audience members. 

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art. 

[SUMMARY] This video documentation features Project 2050, giving a detailed explanation of this initiative’s goals. Roberta Uno, founder and artistic director of New WORLD Theater briefly describes the reach of the project, and explains the metaphor – and demographic projection – that in year 2050 people of color will out number white people. The video presents teachers from the program, discussing the future of art, race, and aesthetics. Also, the video showcases artistic works created by youth artists involved with Project 2050.  In the summer of 2001, these pieces explored identity politics, immigration, incarceration, exploitation, negotiation, and identification as main topics addressed through artistic and activist work. Young performers and their mentors interpellate industrial projects and community survival, discrimination, solidarity, and heritage narratives.  The vitality of the youth art program is felt through student testimonials and it is further related to the necessity to make such program accessible in public schools. As it is highlighted in the credits, all students, artists and scholars, counselors, and staff involved in the project worked together to reach ‘year 2001 and counting….’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] This video documentation features an interview with Roberta Uno, founder and artistic director of New WORLD Theater at the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. She gives an account of New WORLD Theater’s historical trajectory, highlighting the fact that working with young performers from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds require both a critical and committed perspective. Following the mission of providing a multi-cultural space and stage for artists of color, and contrary to the idea of a ‘melting pot,’ she proposes to show the individualities of each tradition, and look for productive dialogues from a comparative approach, which acknowledges and respects similarities and differences. Uno also underlines the importance of funding the theater space through allies in the community and their support to generate a space for cultural diverse work – a work that can only be developed collaboratively.  Uno extends this dialogue into the process of reaching out to the local theater community and working directly with individuals to create performance works that defy cultural biases that a traditional framework may impose upon artists of color. In 1991, New WORLD Theater was in itself a big achievement, being ahead of its time as a cultural institution. By the second decade of the 21st century, it is possible not only to see the development of a visionary project, but also to understand Roberta Uno’s awareness of archiving artistic pieces, and to organize them by topics so that they can be accessible for researchers and artists.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art. 

[SUMMARY] In ‘Time Capsule,’ youth performers explore social-political issues that directly affect their lives. Difference in opportunities based on class, spread violence, the AIDS pandemic, racism, amongst other social and political issues, are embodied on stage and transmitted as concrete realities. The performers intertwine these issues to their own lives through narrative, gesture and song, building little pieces of a social fabric – and addressing a society where they are looking for their own place. From this very personal point of view, they critically evaluate how the world is in the present, and what they expect, fear, and hope for the future

Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art. 

[SUMMARY] In ‘Umoja,’ young members from Project 2050 perform monologues exploring social issues ranging from immigration to women’s liberation. The use of different languages bring together their roots and their future, placing them in-between tradition and futurity. Diverse stories travel from individualities to the history of entire communities: One young performer reflects on her experience as a Vietnamese immigrant pursuing the ‘American Dream.’ Another young performer discusses his inter-racial identity from a Colombian perspective.  Another young performer states her views about feminism from a ‘dark girl’s perspective.’ Among all these different struggles and dreams, there are points of contact and similarities that set the ground for a better future. Thus, the performance ends with the performers collectively dancing and chanting harmoniously in their diversity.

Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art. 

[SUMMARY] In ‘Ashy Ankles,’ Project 2050’s young performers explore oppressive statements around race and gender that they have experienced as young women of color. This oppression is clearly structural when discrimination comes from the ones who must take care of youth and must empower students: the teachers. Repeating the line ‘lies my teacher told me’ with vigorous sound and noise, the young performers on stage materialize the contradictions and isolation they confronted within an education system intended to replicate the same spiral of abuse and discrimination that pervades society. The young women weave chorus song and wording with quickstep movement, thus being empowered by their bodies and voices. They re-appropriate the oppressive statements and affirm their identities from their own viewpoints as women of color, and unveil their teachers’ oppressive gesture claiming that ‘they lied.’ The piece ends with the young women stating ‘they lied’ to point out the false truth of the oppressive statements projected onto them, and defying any pretended determination of their future, showing themselves as creative and strong human beings. By inviting the audience with the statement ‘look at me know,’ they demonstrate that social change is possible from and through each empowered individual.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]

[SYNOPSIS] Project 2050 youth theatre artists presented a series of short works throughout the program. Composed like vignettes, these youth performers present pieces about race, class, immigration, identity politics, and social issues. The youth theatre artists use an array of movement, beatboxing, spoken word, and song, to convey their individual and collective narratives. Racism, prisons, and nationalism are other themes explored in their works. The group works in-between collective struggles and individual stories about themselves. They bring to the stage the same configurations, conflicts, alliances, and acts of solidarity that populate our world. This inspiring evening of short works ends with a hip-hop and breakdance jam session with all youth theatre artists present on stage.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a
vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of
multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting
demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD
Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point
on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a
site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx,
and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western
Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied
the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists
were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches,
methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is
Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with
people of the future — youth, in equal collaboration with artists and
scholars.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]

[SYNOPSIS] This historical documentation features testimonies on the work of the directors and actors of the Third World Theater Series, produced by New WORLD Theater. The Third World Theater Series began in the fall of 1979 as a project of the Student Activities Office of the University of Massachusetts/Amherst. By 1981 it was in its third year and had hosted twelve visiting companies and produced four original plays. In this video, community members discuss what it takes to put on a theatre festival and present political work from multi-racial perspectives and collaborations. They offer their visions of what making ‘new theater’ is, and how to work with people through theater for social and political change. In line with New WORLD Theater ideals, this series promoted a racially diverse theater, political in content, and accessible to lower classes. Performances featured in the series include Homelands, And the Soul Shall Dance, Simpson Street, and Prisims.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a
vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of
multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting
demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD
Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point
on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a
site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx,
and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western
Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied
the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists

Project 2050, an early call to imagine the U.S. demographic shift, with

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] This is a collage of video clips that feature excerpts of performances by artists who collaborated with New WORLD Theater, thus showing the scope and diversity of the entire project. The clips feature pieces of performances by Project 2050, Everett Dance Theatre, Rennie Harris Puremovement, and UNIVERSES. Project 2050’s ‘Ashy Ankles’ explores oppressive statements around race and gender that the performers have experienced as young women of color. Everette Dance Theatre’s piece interweaves spoken dialogue and movement, thus underlining the meaningful roles of voice and body in performance. Rennie Harris Puremovement explores gender and race violence, and the struggles tied to identity politics. Finally, UNIVERSES performs a song that invites to reflect upon race and ethnicity as both a mark of identity and an impulse to create a better future.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] Coatlicue Theater Company's ‘Blood Speaks’ deals with the pivotal role that religion played in the oppression and genocide of native people. In the course of the play the artists reclaim their voices and begin to rewrite history, in their own terms. This video documentation from 1993 features an early stage of Coatlicue’s theater career, where they were developing and strengthening their aesthetic and political proposal. The play opens with a ritual of the beginning of Earth, in dialogue with the characters’ Mayan/Aztec heritage. The stories and history of cultural struggles, from Spanish conquest and colonization to immigration and border politics, have the female body as a central site of violence. 

[BIO] Elvira and Hortencia Colorado, Chichimec Otomi storytellers, playwrights, performers and community activists are founding members of Coatlicue Theater Company (www.coatlicue.com). They are also members of Danza Mexica Cetiliztli, New York Zapatistas and the American Indian Community House. The company's plays address social, political, cultural, and identity issues that impact their lives and their community. Their work is based on stories they weave together, with which they educate as well as entertain the audience. They have conducted storytelling/ theater workshops, and are recipients of the Ingrid Washinawatok Community Activism Award. In 2013, Coatlicue Theater Company celebrated 25 years of performance, culture, and activism.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production. One of New WORLD Theater’s artistic legacies is Project 2050, a multi-year youth arts initiative built on the demographic projection that people of color would become the majority in the United States by 2050. The program brought together professional artists, youth communities from Massachusetts, scholars, and community activists to engage civic dialogue and create original performances based on themes that addressed young performers’ dreams and concerns. Performances were created from workshops that included playwriting, poetry, breakdancing, drumming, beatboxing, lyricism, singing, songwriting, stepping, and visual art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] ‘New Works For a New World’ includes video excerpts of three plays featured by New WORLD Theater’s summer playlab program in 1996. ‘The Bodies Between Us,’ a solo performance by lê thi diem thúy, explores the politics of ‘mixed race’ and generational links through the female body. The piece is a reflection upon relationships with a tradition and racial and ethnic backgrounds as the legacy inherited from ancestors, and what would be given, in turn, to future generations born in the wake of diasporic and migration movements. ‘Chicomoztoc/Mimixcoa--Cloud Serpents,’ by Elvira Colorado and Hortencia Colorado, from Coatlicue Theater Company, is a work-in-progress that discusses the metaphorical relationship between railroad tracks and a family history marked by migration. ‘Las Colorado’ explain the piece as being ‘a journey through dreams, stories, time and memory, across mountains and deserts, retracing the footsteps of the ancestors, traveling back to Chicomoztoc (the place of our origin), searching, digging up and gathering stories that have been buried through centuries of shame and denial in our family, but which connect us to our past and identity. Some stories/secrets remain buried, and they are also part of who we are.’ ‘The Return of Elijah, The African,’ by Sekou Sundiata, interweaves spoken word with jazz singers and band. Music and poetry recount together the origins of slavery, as well as the evils of master-slave dynamics of oppression. ‘New Works For a New World’ constitutes a complex canvas that encompasses the power of diverse languages: the language of the body, the language in translation, the language of music, and the transformative sound of meaningful voices.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] From September 26-29, 2000 on the campus of the University of Massachusetts, New WORLD Theater convened a major national and international gathering, ‘Intersection II,’ a conference/performance festival focused on interdisciplinary and intercultural theater work. ‘Intersection II’ included international participation, while examining innovative theater practice within community, and national and global spheres. The event brought together artists, intellectuals, theater producers, arts presenters, and arts activists to explore the process, evolution, and dynamics of making theater in the dawning moments of the 21st century. One of the featured performances was ‘Antígona,’ directed by Miguel Rubio Zapata and masterfully performed by Teresa Ralli, founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (Peru). This one-woman performance of José Watanabe’s version of Sophocles classic tragedy is a breathtaking example of the devastation caused by twenty years of civil violence in Peru. Although this is the story of only one character, it speaks for the nearly 70,000 disappeared men, women and children of Peru, and for the thousands of survivors who are still fighting for their right to mourn their loved ones.  

[BIO] Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.

New WORLD Theater’s conference and festival also examined new work practices by artists of color and showcased multidisciplinary theater pieces on the cutting edge of new aesthetics. This video documentation of the inauguration and welcoming of ‘Intersection II’ shows how the event bridged the worlds of creativity and scholarship, community activism and professional performance. Roberta Uno discusses the social politics of New WORLD Theater in the same space where Mildred Ruiz enacts this vision and mission through her songs. This event is an example of commitment to further national conversations on cultural equity, emerging aesthetics and activism through the arts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] The performance ‘Contraelviento’ (Against the Wind) was created by Peru’s leading theatre collective Yuyachkani in 1989, at the height of the country’s most recent civil conflict. It recounts the testimony of an indigenous survivor of the 1986 massacre at Soccos, in Ayacucho. Coya and her sister, Huaco, along with their father, are in the midst of colliding forces that destroy everything in the peasant village in the middle of the Andes where they live. The scenes of devastation correspond to the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Army that left civilians with no options for survival. The symbolic seeds of life would represent an option to preserve life, at the expense of the death of the peasants. Masked dancers and archangels fight for ownership of the peasants’ souls in the ‘danza de la diablada’ or Devil dance from the Fiesta de la Candelaria in Puno. After their death, the seeds of life are left by the peasants in the ground, and into the hands of the Ekeko, a constant figure on stage, who performs as witness of the story, and who will transmit both the seeds of life and the narration: ‘these seeds were given to me by a woman, who told me a story.’ The music, images, and voices bring Peruvian traditions to the stage, and at the same time reveal the miscommunications between those who hold power to exert either violence or justice, and the peasants who demand to be taking into account. The difficulties that they have to confront also encompass their constant efforts for survival – as Ekeko affirms: ‘the condor learnt to fly against the wind; now you have to follow him.’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] In this interview, Ana Correa recounts her beginnings with the group, where she found dialogue and openness to create theater. Yuyachkani’s piece ‘Allpa Rayku’ marks the group’s quest for Peruvian deep traditions and the Andean world, as well as Correa’s own identity and connections with her own indigenous roots. Traveling throughout Peru, the group found diverse sources of inspiration for the ‘cholificación’ of their proposal – an aesthetic and political project that encompassed Peruvian local spheres within larger global concerns. The group’s members’ training, and their deep investigation and experience as actors, is intertwined with a self-reflection as a group. Their performances provide a space for marginalized civilians to speak and to be heard, and present the violence suffered by the country in the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Government and Army. The country was devastated by this violence, and sunk in an internal void and fragility. Yuyachkani worked with this, convinced that theater make us better human beings. Correa explains how Yuyachkani actors are companions for the character, who is always in the foreground, and how the group has worked in coordination with popular organizations, NGOs, and communities. She highlights the role of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics’ international events and Encuentros, a space that brings a necessary aperture – a space to sit down together and try to understand each other.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Jesús Martín Barbero, conducted by Diana
Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric
Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?'
The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult
task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well
as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and
embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are
based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of
renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

[BIO] Jesús Martín Barbero is a semiologist, anthropologist, philosopher,
and specialist in communication and media who has produced important
theoretical work on the topic of postmodernity in Latin America. His
contributions include his analysis of culture as a web of mediations, the
semiological study of globalization, the alienating function of the local
media, and the function of telenovelas in Latin America. He has been the
president of the ALAIC (Asociación Latinoamericana de Investigadores de la
Comunicación- Latin American Association of Communications Researchers)
and a member of the Advisory Committee of the FELAFACS (Federación
Latinoamericana de Facultades de Comunicación Social- Latin American
Federation of Schools for Social Communication). He is a member of the
Comité Científico de Infoamérica (Scientific Committee of
Infoamérica).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] This is a video documentation of ‘Clothes,’ a play by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, which discusses complex topics such as racism, multi-cultural relationships, economic disparity, and arranged marriage, from an Indian-American perspective. The main character, Sumita, leaves India for the United States to marry a man she has never met before, and she expresses her anxieties about being exiled from her family. The struggles to adapt to U.S. American culture are symbolically transferred to clothes’ shapes and colors, since Sumita has to trade in her native ‘sari’ for t-shirts and jeans. When Sumita’s husband dies, she is left to choose the life of an independent woman in the United States or return to her in-laws in India. Now a ‘widow in a white sari,’ Sumita vows to stay in the United States despite not knowing how she will survive. Through dance and music that intertwines delicate movements with a subtle but strong body, storytelling transmits the complexity of a female identity that moves between tradition and modernity. The characters’ gestures, and the music, dance, and percussion through the play, reveal a story that is part of a broader history of cultural encounters. 

[BIO] Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is an award-winning author, poet, activist and teacher. Her themes include the Indian experience, contemporary U.S. America, women, immigration, history, myth, and the joys and challenges of living in a multi-cultural world. Her books have been translated into 29 languages, and her work has appeared in over a hundred magazines and anthologies. Several of her novels and stories have been made into films and plays. She has won an American Book Award and a Light of India award. Divakaruni teaches Creative Writing at the University of Houston and writes for both adults and children.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] The Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics held its first Encuentro in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 2-15, 2000. Participants included artists, scholars, graduate students, and activists. This eclectic and culturally diverse group, from countries throughout the Americas, captured the spirit of Encuentros: to provide a forum that encourages an interdisciplinary exploration of the relationship between performance and politics from diverse cultural perspectives. This is a video documentation of the opening remarks by Zeca Ligiéro, Diana Taylor, Luis Peirano, and Javier Serna, who introduce the general theme of the first Encuentro, ‘Performance and Politics in the Americas,’ as well as future events. 

[BIO] The Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics is a collaborative, multilingual and interdisciplinary network of institutions, artists, scholars, and activists throughout the Americas. Working at the intersection of scholarship, artistic expression and politics, the organization explores embodied practice—performance—as a vehicle for the creation of new meaning and the transmission of cultural values, memory and identity. Anchored in its geographical focus on the Americas (thus ‘hemispheric’) and in three working languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese), the Institute's goal is to promote vibrant interactions and collaborations at the level of scholarship, art practice and pedagogy among practitioners interested in the relationship between performance and politics in the hemisphere.

Terena’s perspective, however, is inclusive and open towards
multi-cultural encounters as the ones promoted during the Hemispheric

a ground for dialogue and learning.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[BIO] Based in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

[SYNOPSIS] This staging of Genet's The Maids focuses on the relationships of exploitation and subservience that inform the class differences between the two maids and their rich mistress. The production emphasizes the theme of a feminine universe subjugated to an essentially macho society by having the female characters be played by men. The set—chairs for the audience, a double bed, a wardrobe, and a dresser with a mirror—is decorated with flowers, satin drapes, an altar for a saint that stands for the mistress, and a large painting of a phallus. The staging takes place as a mystic-erotic ceremony, and the entire configuration of the furniture is phallic. In the role playing games the maids play, the ambiguities in their relationship to their mistress become obvious. They are connected to her image by affection, erotism, and hatred, while they nurture a deep feeling of contempt for each other, since they see in each other what they really are. Their greatest desire is not to eliminate the class to which their mistress belongs, but rather to occupy her place in society.

[SYNOPSIS]: In this staging of Beckett's Endgame, the audience has to cross a long tunnel covered in zinc plates to arrive at the desolating image of the four characters, physically limited and trapped in between walls of zinc, consumed by relationships of anguish and resentment. There is a silent and desperate pact between them, where Hamm is the despot who gives the orders which Clov obeys, but it is Clov who determines if the game goes on or not, since he could leave at any time and the others would die. The whole story revolves around the fear that he may leave, but he doesn't, because there is nowhere to go. Even in the end, when he ceases to answer the request of the blind Hamm, Clov stands by his side, still and silent, with a suitcase in hand. Everything ends as it began, and nothing happens.

[SYNOPSIS] In Ostal the audience of only twenty people is guided through a dark tunnel by a doctor, one by one, to the room of a patient, nearly completely occupied by an enormous bed. Once the last audience member enters, the doctor locks the door behind them. The performance takes place in this closed room, fragments from the life of a women tormented by mental illness. Her schizophrenia is portrayed not as a clinical disease, but as an inevitable consequence of the process of social adaptation we are all submitted to since childhood. In search for her identity, she seeks complicity from the audience, while all sorts of strange and violent things happen to her and to the room, without one word being said.

[SYNOPSIS] Following one of Brecht's major premises, that theater should fulfill it's mission of creating critical consciousness while still entertaining, Ói Nóis adapts The exception and the rule to the streets. The story of the merchant and the porter who get lost in the desert is complemented by a chorus of seven performers, who sing the events using Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and a body of eleven performers that personifies the geography, the animals, and the feelings of the story.

[SYNOPSIS] This staging of Goethe's Faust recreates one of the most universal esoteric myths of all times, that of the man who sells his soul to the devil. The entire story of Faust is staged, but not the whole text nor all the scenes. Instead, the audience of 30 people is guided through a succession of dreamlike environments, in a journey towards the unconscious of the character. Ói Nóis' Faust brings up the question of who is, after all, the Faustian man of our time: Is it the scientist and the politician, or the outsider, the one who contests the system? This story reveals to the audience two essential factors for human emancipation: the desire for knowledge and the pleasure principal, both crucial for fighting power and fueling revolutions.

For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

[SYNOPSIS]: Borrowing from history the famous sentence used by Dom Pedro I to declare the Independence of Brazil, 'Independence or Death!', Ói Nóis creates a new and unofficial version of the formation of Brazilian society. The purpose is to demystify the so-called 'heroes,' and to put the true workforce and culture of this country into its rightful place. The invasion of the land of the Native Americans and the expatriation and enslavement of African peoples serve as a narrative structure, exemplifying the oppression and poverty in which the majority of the Brazilians still live. The light-hearted and ironic tone with which the official 'heroes' are treated brings some air to the moldy way the history of this country has been told, praising the name of a few while neglecting the rest.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[BIO] Based in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

[SYNOPSIS]: Based on Augusto Boal’s play 'O homem que era uma fábrica,' this street performance tells the story of Matilda Silva da Silva, an unemployed Brazilian woman who is trying to get a visa do the United States in order to fulfill her dream of a job and a place to live. Helped by her friend Santinha, Matilda needs to go through several obstacles to overcome the sanitary rules of the United States embassy, which bar the people of Pindaíba from imigrating. Free from amoebas and bacteria, our hero transforms her fecal matter in a symbol for Brazilian clean feces, creating the possibility of becoming rich selling feces to all those people who also dream with the pleasures of the 'American way of life.' Registering Brazil’s social situation through allegory and farce, the clown characters are an expression of Brazil’s popular theatre, establishing a connection with the people in the streets. The humor and playfulness hide a strong critical power.

[SYNOPSIS] In Hamletmachine, Heiner Müller finds the site for the revolutionary construction of a new theater. His texts are formed of fragments, shattered scenes, and derisory monologues, stimuli for the creative invention of a performed reality, the only reality capable of transgressively translating the complexity of contemporary existence. In one of the final scenes in Ói Nóis' adaptation, the dead figure of Stalin appears in the TV monitors, while three naked actresses parade wearing giant heads of Marx, Lenin and Mao. The characters and scenes are pulverized and multifaceted, allowing for distinct and contradictory readings, which provide for countless concrete political interpretations and symbolic references.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[BIO] La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation.
 
[SYNOPSIS] Nayra is collective creation of La Candelaria that explores the unconscious and the popular worldview about health, death, and displacement. ‘Nayra’ is an Aymara word that means ‘eye,’ but can also mean ‘ancestors,’ ‘memory’ and ‘vision.’ Director Santiago García describes the piece as ‘an exploration of our myths and legends as both Colombians and Latin Americans.’ This piece enacts a time/space of assemblages that address the quest for connections more than the connections per se. By the end of the piece, mirrors blow to pieces, thus recalling not only a fragmented shared memory, but also a country crushed by violence.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[BIO] H.I.J.O.S. (Hijos e Hijas por la Identidad y la Justicia contra el Olvido y el Silencio) is a national and international organization founded in 1995 by the sons and daughters of disappeared persons during the dictatorship in Argentina. Their objective is to continue their parents’ social struggles, find young people kidnapped by the military, and fight against impunity. The members of H.I.J.O.S. are not only the children of the ‘detenidos-desaparecidos,’ but also ex-political prisoners, exiled people, and other citizens who might not have directly suffered the repression of the Argentinian civic-military dictatorship, but who understand that we all are children of the same history.
The Grupo de Arte Callejero (GAC) has engaged in acts of urban intervention since the late 80s, dealing with issues of human rights. Together with H.I.J.O.S., GAC actively participates in the “escraches” (acts of public shaming) that expose the specific places where dictatorship has carried out its injustice and impunity—e.g., current homes of ex-torturers, buildings that were used as detention and torture centers, etc. During recent years, GAC has expanded its activism to single out other modes of injustice under democracy, such as the criminalization of social protests, the impunity of police officers in the state of security, the news media’s monopoly and the housing market.
 
[SYNOPSIS] In this video documentation, H.I.J.O.S., in collaboration with Grupo de Arte Callejero, give background and details about their work. The video features scenes of their acción in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, during the first Hemispheric Institute Encuentro, in Rio de Janeiro, 2000. They placed signs in the streets, reminding all the pending cases of torture, murder, and disappearance during the Argentine dictatorship that are still waiting for justice. With this acción, words, and music,  they intend to grab the attention of people in the streets so that they can engage in a conversation about Human Rights in different Latin American countries. The video clip also features parts of their workshops.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of La Pocha Nostra’s “Chicano apocalíptico,’ performed  during the first Hemispheric Institute Encuentro, in Rio de Janeiro, 2000. In this performance piece, Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Roberto Sifuentes explore the connections between the body in pain and the mass of political bodies wounded by border violence, racist institutions, and homogenizing culture ideologies. Their ethno-techno proposal brings together that which has been labeled as ‘primitive’ and the technologies of the present.

[BIO] La Pocha Nostra is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels.The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier. These are radical acts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[BIO] Visual and performance artist Ema Villanueva (1975, Mexico City) performs in the streets as well as in established cultural spaces of Mexico. Her at times controversial performance projects, mostly done in collaboration with Eduardo Flores (collective name, EDEMA) include: Todo se vale (strip-tease político) (Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado ‘La Esmeralda’ 1999); Pasionaria, caminata por la dignidad, street intervention, 2000); Ausencia (Ninth Performance Festival of Ex Teresa, 2000, the Red de Derechos Humanos a Todos Para Todos, and the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics of the Americas, 2001); Orgullosamente UNAM (Department of Political and Social Sciences of the UNAM, 2001). Villanueva has participated in several round tables and conferences in art schools around Mexico City. Her work has been reviewed in major newspapers such as Reforma, La Jornada and Milenio, and discussed in academic papers and conference presentations.

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of a performance by EDEMA in collaboration with Carlos Ezequiel Monteros (H.I.J.O.S.) and Pilar Medina (group Contraseña, Monterrey), presented at the second Hemispheric Institute Encuentro in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2001. They got together to expand alliances with groups that work on similar topics: the disappeared people during dictatorships, and the necessity to denounce impunity. EDEMA unveils the trauma of disappeared bodies through the striking the materiality of a body on stage. Sensorial stimuli accompany the bodily presence: sound, noise, percussion, fire, dance are mingled with pictures, videos, and pictures of the disappeared. With this performance, EDEMA points out that forced disappearance is a crime related not only to Latin American dictatorships, but also to democratic governments’ responsibilities: ‘el silencio es cómplice de la ausencia’ (silence is complicit of absence).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[BIO] EDEMA is a collaboration between Ema Villanueva and Eduardo Flores. Ema Villanueva (1975, Mexico City) is a visual and performance artist who performs in the streets as well as in established cultural spaces of Mexico. She has participated in several round tables and conferences in art schools around Mexico City. Her work has been reviewed in major newspapers such as Reforma, La Jornada and Milenio, and discussed in academic papers and conference presentations.
Eduardo Flores Castillo (Ciudad de México, 1971) is an artist, educator, and researcher of performance art. He has presented his performance work and has given workshops and lectures in different cities in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States. He has also published articles in specialized journals in Mexico and Cuba. 

[SYNOPSIS] In this interview, Ema Villanueva and Eduardo Flores discuss their artistic collaboration and their participation in projects focused on social justice. They highlight the relationship between the social, the political, and the body through the arts. They offer their perspective on their trajectory, and their collaborative work techniques. They also discuss the students strike at the UNAM (Universidad Autónoma de México) in 2000. As a response, they performed a walk to memorialize the more than one thousand students imprisoned by military forces in a space that should remain autonomous and free of violence.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Starting with a semiotic performative that states ‘this is not a performance,’ this lecture/performance is another turn of the screw of René Magritte’s ‘this is not a pipe’ and Fernando Muñoz’ ‘this is not a cow.’ The relationship between performance and art tradition intertwines with a constant interpellation of the audience, blurring the boundaries between art and life. In the Q&A, Maris Bustamante renders her understanding of what non-objective arts are, and how gender roles can perform in art. A juicy conversation about her trajectory includes insights about gender and sexuality, feminist art, maternity, and her work with Polvo de gallina negra and No-Grupo. 

[BIO] Maris Bustamante is neo trans post conceptualist strident visual producer. Since her first happening in 1971, Maris Bustamante (1949, Mexico) — a graduate from the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda at Mexico City—began ‘a search for non-traditional support’ or what she called ‘non-objective art.’ In 1977, along with other artists, she started a movement of ‘savage vanguard’ called ‘No-Grupo.’ With No-Grupo Bustamante created humored and caustic performances where gender was a major source material. In 1983, Bustamante and Mónica Mayer founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder) - a name based in the popular belief that black hen’s powder is a protection against evil eye or, in this case, attacks against feminism.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of a performance by/for an intimate audience, marked by conversational and relational interactions. ‘Cry a la Jack’ is a performance/homage to queer experimental filmmaker Jack Smith. Carmelita Tropicana explains to the audience how she became a performance artist, and she offers her ‘performance art manifesto’ and her definition of performance art: ‘Performance art just changes your perception. Objects that you thought are no longer the same objects.’ Bringing together the body and life and death, she remembers Jack Smith’s presence everywhere, and thanks him for making her ‘the ‘thesbian’ that I am today.’ Remembering that Jack prompted her to cry on stage, she cuts an onion to provoke tears. She asks audience members to take a whiff of the onion and asks what would they cry about. She finally burst into song remembering Jack and, in doing so, bringing his presence close to her: ‘You light up my days and fill my life with sun...it can’t be wrong when it feels so right...you, you, you, Jack, light up my life.’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Proust ate a cookie and his childhood memories came rushing back. Will Carmelita Tropicana eat a yuca and be cured of her amnesia? Will she have to go back to her homeland, Cuba? And if she goes back, will she fall into a CUMA --Collective Unconscious Memory Appropriation Attack? ‘Milk of Amnesia’ is a work that blends the persona of Carmelita with the more personal voice of her creator, Alina Troyano, who describes the hardships of growing up as a transplanted child. This is a one woman travelogue that shifts from the U.S. to Cuba, from modern times to colonial times, from public persona to the private self, presenting an array of characters, some male (Pingalito Betancourt, a cigar chomping macho Cuban bus driver) some female (Carmelita Tropicana, a cross between Lucy and Desi) and some animal (Arriero, Hernan Cortez’s horse).
 
[BIO] Alina Troyano (a.k.a.Carmelita Tropicana) is a Cuban-born performance artist, playwright, and actor who has presented work internationally, from el Museo del Barrio in NYC to Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. Her book, ‘I, Carmelita Tropicana: Performing Between Cultures’ includes plays, monologues, performance art pieces, and short stories. In Tropicana’s work humor and fantasy become subversive tools to rewrite history.  Tropicana’s performances plays and videos have been presented at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, Hebbel Am Ufer in Berlin, Centre de Cultura Contemporanea in Barcelona, the Berlin International Film Festival, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, the Mark Taper Forum’s Kirk Douglas Theater in Los Angeles, and El Museo del Barrio in New York. She has received numerous awards including the prestigious Anonymous Was a Woman and fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts as well as an Obie for Sustained Excellence in Performance.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] This video features documentation of an interview with Alina Troyano/Carmelita Tropicana at the Second Hemispheric Institute Encuentro, "Memory, Atrocity and Resistance", in Monterrey, Mexico from June 14-23, 2001. With a great dose of humor, Carmelita begins the interview by giving a brief introduction of herself and her relationship with the Hemispheric Institute Encuentro. She discusses her roots in Havana, Cuba and her experiences of migrating to the United States. She also remembers the legendary night of performance surrounding identity politics at New Museum, The Studio Museum, and The Museum of Hispanic Arts (performers included Guillermo Gomez-Peña, David Wojnarowicz, and James Luna amongst others). It was this evening of performance as part of ‘The Decade Show: Frameworks of Identity in the 1980s’ that changed Carmelita's writing into a different personal tone and multi-dimensional style, referencing ‘Milk of Amnesia’ at PS122 as an example of such writing. 

[BIO] Alina Troyano (a.k.a.Carmelita Tropicana) is a Cuban-born performance artist, playwright, and actor who has presented work internationally, from el Museo del Barrio in NYC to Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. Her book, ‘I, Carmelita Tropicana: Performing Between Cultures’ includes plays, monologues, performance art pieces, and short stories. In Tropicana’s work humor and fantasy become subversive tools to rewrite history.  Tropicana’s performances plays and videos have been presented at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, Hebbel Am Ufer in Berlin, Centre de Cultura Contemporanea in Barcelona, the Berlin International Film Festival, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, the Mark Taper Forum’s Kirk Douglas Theater in Los Angeles, and El Museo del Barrio in New York.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] The boundary-smashing ‘Slanguage’ brings together the unique mix of language and culture that is life on the United States’ streets. Built loosely around the structure of a subway ride from Brooklyn to the Bronx, this piece synthesizes traditional theater with poetry, storytelling, rap, gospel, jazz riffs, bluesy laments, Spanish boleros, and other poetic forms, to paint a rich portrait of the sights and sounds of New York City. Through ‘Slanguage,’ Universes integrates theatre and street humor with emotional truth, amplifying the issues of poverty, family, drugs, racism, and street violence, yet finding hope in the contemporary urban landscape, and believing in the power of language to create social change through collective words, stories, and narratives.

[BIO] Universes is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of  multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Universes performs a piece at the Andy Warhol Museum as part of Off the Wall, a contemporary performance series held at the museum. A different setting from a theater, the museum space invites a more intimate performance, with minimal stage design, and bare white lighting. The ensemble performs excerpts of work-in-progress pieces, particularly ‘Slanguage,’ a comment on the issues of poverty, family, drugs, racism, and street violence, yet finding hope in the contemporary urban landscape, and believing in the power of language to create social change through collective words, stories, and narratives.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of Open Studio, a space that showcased different work in progress processes. In this rehearsal exploration, the topic of artistic creation’s crisis transverses the stage. ‘Blue Suite’ (aka ‘Eyewitness Blues’) is an affecting portrait of artists and the vibrant culture, traditions, and personal experience they bring to their work. When Junior, a hard-luck horn player prepares to play his instrument, his Duende appears and suddenly his life unfolds in a series of provocative vignettes told through a stirring mix of jazz, flamenco, blues and poetry. Led by his Duende, Junior is forced to confront his own mystery. Here, they battle to the death as Jazz idly argues its own existence. Utilizing Lorca’s Flamenco Duende and summoning Miles Davis’ ‘Sketches of Spain,’ ‘Blue Suite’ takes us on an internal journey, where art lays at the balance as passion fades. This video documentation also features a Q&A with the audience.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] In this performance’s dress rehearsal, Universes sings the sorrows of poverty surrounding the American landscape with a focus on New Orleans and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Song and movement are accompanied by vivid images and video projected on screen, commenting on issues of gentrification, natural disaster, class warfare, racial discrimination, and economic oppression.  The piece also critiques the lack of healthcare coverage, religious hierarchy, and the wealthy in the States. Universes activates our political imagination, considering the possibility of artists, poets, and activists taking the places of government officials, where the common everyday person can work as an individual and as a part of a community.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS]  Mildred Ruiz and Steven Sapp of Universes give an artist talk about their performance work.  The artist talk begins with a live excerpted performance from Ameriville, following with a screening of the group’s trajectory.  Since meeting each other at Bard College in upstate New York, Steven Sapp and Mildred Ruiz have always returned to the Bronx to find and to build a run down community. In response to seeing the crime, drug use, and violence in the Bronx, Steven and Mildred created ‘The Point’ community center, where Universes became a theatre group and began a journey of making performance work. The artist talk is followed by a Q&A with audience members.

[BIO] Universes is a New York-based poetic theatre ensemble company of  multi-disciplinary writers and performers who fuse poetry, theater, jazz, hip-hop, politics, down home blues, and Hispanic boleros to create moving, challenging and entertaining theatrical works. The group breaks traditional theatrical bounds to explore new ways of making theater. Founded in New York in 1996, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop and residencies with New WORLD Theater, their work is now internationally acclaimed. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [BIO] Based in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz
was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language
of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created
a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on
the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de
Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school,
offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal
organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the
creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui
Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality,
and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge
and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world
marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and
barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce
injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of
memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of
arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics
and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle
for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in
it.


[SYNOPSIS] Based on Sophocles' play, this performance intertwines text fragments by Albert Camus, Anaïs Nin, Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht, Dante Alighieri, Edgar Alan Poe, Ezra Pound, Fiodor Dostoievski, Friedrich Nietzsche, Heiner Müller, Hölderlin, Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, Jean Paul Sartre, Julian Beck, Lao Tsé, and Mallarmé. Ói Nóis found in the Greek Tragedy of Sophocles a space to
discuss the civil disobedience of the individual against the oppression of
the State. The play is adapted into an environmental performance, beggining
with the battle between Thebes and Argos in the courtyard of the Terreira,
and progressing through the five different environment the audience
crosses, including a desert covered in tons of sand. The adaptation does
not follow the classical structure but is divided into a non-realistic
sequence of 30 scenes, including a dialogue between a mother and a son who
deserted war, an added scene that tells the story from the point of view of
the people instead of that of nobility, which classical tragedy privileges.
The performance lasts three hours and accomodates fifty spectators, who are
invited both to watch and to participate in scenes such as the 'Bacchanal,'
featuring the cutting off and ritual burial of a giant phallus that Creonte
wears by a Maenad. Text fragments from Camus, Artaud, Brecht, Nietzsche,
Heiner Müller, Julian Beck, and several other authors, are intertwined
into the narrative with the purpose of opening up the Greek story into
other political situations.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] This is a video documentation of a psycho-sexual empowering journey where performer and audience share intimacy, humor, and affects. Tim Miller explores bits and pieces of his body, in the same manner than, piece by piece, the story keeps flowing and ‘giving birth’ to the queer body. Through storytelling and movement, and stories of love, enchantment, disenchantment, and resistance, this solo show transforms a personal story into the story of a community. The ghost of fear and death appears with the AIDS epidemic, the loss of friends and loved ones, police brutality against gay people, and the State of California anti gay laws and homophobic harassment. A travel in time through the body, Tim Miller’s striking performance invokes the bodies of those who are absent but present at the same time. The gesture of envisioning a future with a United States’ lesbian president, with sexual freedom, and without homophobia, transforms sex into a call to life and hope. 

[BIO] Tim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's creative work as a performer and writer explores the artistic, spiritual and political topography of his identity as a gay man. Miller's performances have been presented all over North America, Australia, and Europe in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, the Institute of Contemporary Art (London), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller’s most recent book 1001 BEDS, an anthology of his performances, essays and journals, was published by University of Wisconsin Press in 2006. Miller has taught performance at UCLA, NYU, the School of Theology at Claremont and at universities all over the US. He is a co-founder of two of the most influential performance spaces in the United States: Performance Space 122 on Manhattan's Lower East Side and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, CA. After a nine-year stint in New York City, in 1987 Miller returned home to Los Angeles, California where he was born and raised. He currently lives there with his partner Alistair in Venice Beach.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] The sound and physicality of breath comes to the forefront when sexual climax, life, and death intertwine. Presenting vignettes of life, love, suffering, and humor, Tim Miller offers a compelling storytelling about his own life in NYC in the 80s, signaling breathing as life assurance in a moment when the AIDS epidemic and the work with ACT UP dwelled in-between survival and disappearance. This solo piece emerged from Miller's aesthetic ambition to mirror gay society's cultural conflicts while ‘trying to find an artistic, spiritual and political response to the AIDS crisis.’ ‘Do it like your life depends on it,’ Miller declares, breathing rhythmically and deeply, ‘which it does. In and out. Breathe. Breathe out the lie that we don't belong together. Breathe in the love. Run naked through the streets of L.A. Proclaim the end of sadness. Celebrate the miracle of us.’ Song and water make the body vulnerable and strong at the same time, in connection with all those that might be dead but not really gone.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Glory Box is a funny, sexy and charged exploration of Tim Miller's journeys through the challenge of love, gay marriage, and the struggle for immigration rights for gay Americans and their partners from other countries. From Miller's hilarious grade school playground battles over wanting to marry another boy to the harrowing travails of being in a bi-national relationship with his Australian lover, Glory Box leads the audience on an intense and humorous journey into the complexity of the human heart that knows no boundary. In Miller’s words, ‘I want the pieces to conjure for the audience a site for the placing of memories, hopes, and dreams of gay people's extraordinary potential for love.’

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
In a fusion of song, poetry, lecture and demonstration, acclaimed eco-chef Bryant Terry delves into the origins of ‘Soul Food’. Though often portrayed as an extremely unhealthy cuisine, Terry traces Soul Food back to its plant-based origins and, in so doing, explores the intersections of institutional racism, poverty, and food insecurity. His extensive research into the history of the popular cuisine reveals both little-explored information about what Soul Food is, but also provides an opportunity for reclamation of ethnic cuisine and heritage. As Terry says, this knowledge will hopefully help move African-Americans, specifically, and others away from unhealthy stereotypes and the more indulgent foods which should only be eaten occasionally. As a chef and a food justice activist, Terry is committed to healthy and sustainable foodways as well as preserving cultural food legacies.

The audience is in for a brilliant homage and a great surprise when Swift makes a cameo. From breakdancing to concert halls, Olive Dance Theatre’s performance exemplifies the multigenerational, multicultural range of Swift’s work.

A pioneering B-Boy, Swift began B-Boying in 1978 at the age of twelve. He is credited with creating numerous dance moves and is recognized the world over as one of the most influential dancers in the genre of breakdancing.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]Dan Wolf (d.wolf) and Tommy Shepherd (Soulati) are founders of the hip hop music and theater collective Felonious (previously Felonious Punks). Evolving from an a capella duo to a full band where they blend hard-hitting lyrics with the sounds of reggae, jazz, funk and latin music resulting in an unbeatable combination. Beatbox: A Raparetta is their first of many productions and has been staged in New York, San Francisco, Oakland, and Germany. A story of two step-brothers who make their way through life as hip hop street performers, the play explores the streets and the music that brought them together and threaten to rip them apart. As a friend from Mickey Finch’s (Tommy Shepherd) past re-enters the picture, Tet begins to feel left out and begins spiraling downward in an engrossing tale that engages until the gut-wrenching finale. [BIO] TOMMY SHEPHERD A.K.A Emcee Soulati is an actor, playwright, b-boy, rapper, drummer, beatboxer, educator, and a former resident artist with the Hybrid Project at San Francisco's Intersection for the Arts. He has performed in the dance theatre piece "One window" by the Erika Shuch Performance Project, and was an actor, musical director and live vocal musician "A Fist of Roses" by Philip Kan Gotanda created with Campo Santo + Intersection. He is also co-founder of the live hip hop band Felonious: onelovehiphop. Felonious plays throughout the state and also develops and creates theatrical productions. Dan Wolf is a multi-disciplinary performer who combines conventional theater styles with the themes, language, music and aesthetics of hip-hop. He is a founding member of the hip-hop collective Felonious and a former resident artist with the Hybrid Project at San Francisco's Intersection for the Arts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SUMMARY] A one-woman show set on Anyblock USA, Hanifah Walidah’s Black Folks Guide to Black Folks is a powerful production confronting issues of health, love, homophobia, and more in the black community.

[BIO] Hanifah Walidah is a musician, playwright, educator and social arts activist. She currently is touring internationally as lead singer-songwriter for electro-soul band St.Lô.

Recent projects include the feature length award winning rocumentary U People and the nationally noted Black Folks’ Guide to Black Folks, a one-woman show and feature-length film imagining and stimulating conversations among queer and straight communities of color in the contemporary U.S. She is a founding member of the well-known New York City women of color theatre cabaret, Rivers of Honey.﻿

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SUMMARY] A one-woman show set on Anyblock USA, Hanifah Walidah’s Black Folks Guide to Black Folks is a powerful production confronting issues of health, love, homophobia, and more in the black community. Walifah moves fluidly in and out of her characters, crafting vivid imagery and conversation about some of the most difficult topics today. From the woman who runs the neighborhood day care center to a community elder named Top Pop, Walidah remains faithful to familiar characters in the black community, all the while blurring and laughing at the borders dividing race, gender, and more. A gifted writer, performer, and musician, Hanifah Walidah brings grace and depth to her characters and to the stage. [BIO] Hanifah Walidah is a musician, playwright, educator and social arts activist. She currently is touring internationally as lead singer-songwriter for electro-soul band St.Lô. Her rich, twenty- year career has taken an ethnographic approach to the arts to create culturally relevant film, music, and stage works that help foster social change. Recent projects include the feature length award winning rocumentary U People and the nationally noted Black Folks’ Guide to Black Folks, a one-woman show and feature-length film imagining and stimulating conversations among queer and straight communities of color in the contemporary U.S. She is a founding member of the well-known New York City women of color theatre cabaret, Rivers of Honey.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
A poetic look at the violence- both external and internal- wreaking havoc in the lives of black men, In the Last Car is one man’s story whose implications reach far beyond his life. From everyday encounters to relationship struggles, from substance abuse to subway rides, protagonist Agaceez’s lyrical exploration is poignant as he is kidnapped by some very dark characters, and manages to discover his purpose. The play is an intimate glance at the struggles taking place in the last car, and other places that too often go overlooked.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
A chance encounter occurs between an aspiring club DJ, his agent, her ex-boyfriend, and a bike messenger and no one is ever the same. Through a blend of culture, sexuality and music the entrance of the mysterious stranger forces the romantic triad to face each other and themselves in Greg Beuthin’s Rewind (A Soundtrack for Longing). What begins as an ordinary day with ordinary people becomes a poignant look at war, culture, and love. This staged reading was presented as part of the NYC Hip-Hop Theater Festival.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
A head-on confrontation of issues such as school shootings, child abuse, and more, The Suicide Kings’ In Spite of Everything is a seminal work in both spoken word performance and activist art. Featuring one of the fiercest Bay Area hip-hop collectives, under the direction of GOLDIE award-winning, Bay Area legend Marc Bamuthi Joseph, the story weaves through the days following the tragic event and the lives of both the perpetrators and victims to reveal the underlying issues, both institutional and personal, that lead to bullying and youth violence in schools. Opening with a group of writing workshop leaders at the head of a classroom, the fun is quickly stilled as the scene shifts to a police interrogation of one of the instructors about the biggest school shooting since Columbine. What happens next is as riveting as it is heartbreaking. The artists take the audience on a critical journey through fear-inducing journalism, violent video games, and more to reveal that violence and shootings in school cannot only be blamed on the perpetrator.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
When Wally’s troubled young life comes to an abrupt end, he is more than a little surprised to meet his hero, Tupac Shakur, on the other side. With the slain rapper as his guide, Wally is witness to the revelations of Tupac in the afterlife. Among regrets of lost love and falling prey to life in the street, Wally learns valuable lessons about life and what you take with you far beyond the grave. Giving Up the Gun is a poignant examination of life, death, and what comes after.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

Derived from African folklore, Zomo the Rabbit is placed in a 21st century context and re-emerges as a trickster- a traditional African archetype- who carries a boom box and spits rap lyrics. After being dissed by some of the other animals saying he doesn’t have talent, Zomo calls the Sky God from his cell phone and asks to be gifted with power. She assigns him three tasks: to retrieve the dance shoes of Big Fish, the spray paint can from Wild Cow, and the turntable from DJ the Leopard. As Zomo embarks on a grand journey he encounters creatures from all over who ultimately help him complete all three tasks and learn a very important lesson. As the journey unfolds, so does the show’s message about friendship, art, and what the truest source of power really is. Tight lyrics and tongue-in-cheek humor make this show enjoyable for children and adults alike.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
A tale of teachers, artists, and activists, Danny Hoch’s Till the Break of Dawn takes place in the Havana of 2001. Chronicling the meetings and mishaps that happen at a Cuban hip-hop festival, the New Yorkers are confronted by numerous struggling Cubans, an exiled Black Panther, and youth from the global hip-hop scene. It is in this changing landscape where they must confront their changing ideas and commitments to activism, and to each other. Culminating with the events of September 11th, Till the Break of Dawn is a critical look at the cultures of American imperialism, idealism, and hip-hop that affects each of the characters.

This work is written and directed by acclaimed actor, poet, and playwright Danny Hoch. A two-time DEF poet, a Senior Fellow at the New School’s Vera List Center for Arts & Politics among numerous other awards and accolades, Hoch is the founder of the Hip Hop Theater Festival.

Hip-Hop Theater Festival is dedicated to presenting and showcasing theater written by and about the Hip-Hop generation. Since 2004, its creators have worked with emerging and established artists to develop work that broadens conversations around Hip-Hop on a global scale. Dedicated to inciting dialogue and social change, HHTF recognizes the power of Hip-Hop and the power of theater as a medium.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] This video piece is a homage to Mexican temporary contract laborers who participated in the Mexican Farm Labor Program, informally known as the Bracero Program. It presents archival photos from the Bracero History Archive and the photographic series 'Braceros at 80' by Craig Sherod. Featuring music by Los Cenzontles with David Hidalgo & Taj Mahal from their American Horizon CD, accompanied by descriptions of the Bracero Program. Started in 1942 by the U.S. government, the Bracero Program used migration to reduce labor shortage by World War II. In a 22 year period, the program allowed entry to over 4 million Mexican men to work in the U.S. 
[BIO] Los Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles produces original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its  founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and cultural-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] This piece is a video montage in which Los Cenzontles recreate Neil Young's classic song ‘Cortez the Killer.’ In this video Los Cenzontles continue their exploration of Mexican cultural roots by describing the encounter between Hernán Cortés and the Aztec people. Using footage of Aztec ruins and clips of people performing traditional dances, the video underlines the forced disappearance of an entire civilization while presenting the importance of preserving cultural heritage.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Video with Spanish audio and English subtitles in which Los Cenzontles perform a corrido about the politics of migration in Arizona during the spring of 2010. The musical performance merges with footage from the migrant mobilization against SB 1070. On April 23, 2010, Governor Jan Brewer signed 'Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,' known as Arizona SB 1070. At the time of passage, SB 1070 became the harshest measure against ‘illegal’ immigration. The law requires police to determine the immigration status of anyone arrested or detained when there is ‘reasonable suspicion’ they do not have the required documentation to live and work in the U.S. The law, considered as an excuse for racial profiling,  inspired protests and political coalitions among minority groups, and reignited the immigrant rights movement. 

[BIO] Los Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles produces original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its  founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and cultural-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] In 2000, the young people of Los Cenzontles assumed administrative positions, expanding the organization’s ‘Grow Your Own’ methodology into administrative leadership. Working with immigrant communities to raise awareness about cultural transition, the group collaborates with communities of migrant Mexicans who perform hard labor and whose children go to the same schools as white children. At those schools, cultural tensions are rife. As creative community leaders, Los Cenzontles has developed methods to create programing built on community assets, and to encourage cultural translation.

The video situates the viewer in a soccer table game in which members of Los Cenzontles are moved by an outside force while a ball hits them. These actions are presented as an analogy to the way Mexican Americans are treated in the U.S. The video also displays statistical facts about the reality of the growing presence of Latinos in the U.S. and its impact in elections and the economy. 

[BIO] Los Cenzontles is a band, a nonprofit organization, a music academy, a community space for youth and families, and a hub for Latino artists. Since 1989 Los Cenzontles produces original music, videos, and educational tools, playing a central role in Mexican roots revival in the United States. Throughout more than 25 years of constant work, Los Cenzontles has shared its  founder Eugene Rodriguez’ vision: that young people empowered as artists and teachers can build upon the past to create a better future. Los Cenzontles remains unique among nonprofits nationally in demonstrating the potential of Latino cultural programming and production to transform individuals and communities from within. Over the years, the academy has served immigrant children, third-generation Mexican Americans as well as children who are mixed and from various ethnic backgrounds. The band has recorded songs that capture the poetry of the indigenous Purépecha language and composed music aimed to inspire and rally the community toward empowerment and engagement and against contemporary injustices. Los Cenzontles has broadcast its journey via its documentary series, web-based video shorts, and ‘digital scrapbooks’ aimed at capturing the first person stories of resilience by Mexican American music- and cultural-makers. These media productions combine music videos and interviews to highlight themes of inclusion, education, and social justice.

The video is juxtaposed with footage from early 20'th century U.S. cinema and cartoons - another example of Los Cenzontles’ eclectic work.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Directed by Ricardo Braojos and Produced by Eugene Rodriguez of Los Cenzontles Cultural Arts Academy. Pasajero: A Journey of Time and Memory, a one-hour documentary, follows a group of young inner-city Mexican-American musicians to Mexico where they seek a deeper meaning of its traditions. They accompany their teacher, an elderly violinist, on his homecoming to his pueblo in Jalisco. The group tours a musical presentation of a long-forgotten style of pre-commercial mariachi in Mexico and California's Central Valley where they meet fascinating characters that embody the spirit of old Mexico. Pasajero is a heartfelt reminder of the vital role that music plays in defining our identities.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Music video by Los Cenzontles that merges live performance and photographies. Included in their 2010 CD Raza de Oro, this song narrates the story of a Mexican man who has lost his job. As a result of his unemployment he cannot send remittances back to his wife. His wife, in turn, asks him to leave the U.S. for Mexico to reunite with his family. This story portrays the experiences of many Mexican men who had to return to their home country because of the recession that affected the U.S.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Antonio Araújo's lecture is a discussion of theatrical experiments performed in streets and public spaces of the São Paulo neighborhood of Bom Retiro during the creative process of Teatro da Vertigem's Bom Retiro 958 Metros. From the practice of the situationist-inspired dérive used as a device for field research, to improvisations, to urban games conducted in the open and in dialogue with architecture and the layout of the neighborhood––Teatro da Vertigem's whole process was marked by experiences of urban intervention. Miguel Rubio's lecture explores how dramatic languages expand and invade public space, converging with citizen actions. To this end, he looks at several recent artistic proposals that act on and in public spaces––inserting themselves into social processes in the context of contemporary Peruvian society.

[BIOS] Antonio Araújo is Artistic Director of Teatro da Vertigem and Professor in the Department of Performing Arts of ECA-USP. With Teatro da Vertigem, he has directed O Paraíso Perdido; O Livro de Jó; Apocalipse 1, 11; BR-3; Bom Retiro 958 Metros, among other works. He has been invited to teach on site specific and urban performance internationally. He was awarded the Golden Medal in the category of Best Realization of a Production for BR-3, in the Prague Quadrennial 2011. Miguel Rubio is a director, theater researcher, and founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. His most recent directions include: Con-cierto Olvido (2010); El último ensayo (2008); Sin Título-técnica mixta (2004); Hecho en el Perú-Vitrinas para un Museo de la Memoria (2001). He is also author of Raíces y semillas: Maestros y caminos del teatro en América Latina (2011), Notas sobre el teatro (2001) and El cuerpo ausente (2008).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
'Algo en la cocina,' by Arthur Aviles, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute  of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary -, in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES |ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex 'passions' that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present—fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others. 

In ‘Algo en la cocina,’ Arthur Aviles transits in-between the flux of the masculine and the feminine, and beyond. Dance movements that are delicate, precise, and strong at the same time, touch the flexible matter of which our bodies are made, and demonstrate that gender, sexuality, and eroticism are an invitation to enjoy life.   

Arthur Aviles was born in Queens and grew up in Long Island and the Bronx. received a B/A in Theatre/Dance from BARD college. He was a member of Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from '87 to '95 and received a New York Dance and performance award (Bessie) in 1989. He founded his dance company Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre in '96. In '98, he along with Charles Rice-Gonzalez inaugurated a new performance space in the South Bronx. BAAD! - The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond.

[BIOS] Gonzalo Rabanal (Chile) studied Audio Visual Communication at the ARCOS Institute, where he began to develop a way of working that projects from individual to collective, opening up space for an expressive multiplicity. In 1989 he received a grant from the ANDES Foundation and in 2010 another from the Ford Foundation. He is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Visual Art at the Pontificia Universidad Católica in Chile.

María José Contreras Lorenzini (Chile) is performer and Doctor of Body Language and Psychology.

Nao Bustamante (USA) is an internationally known and beloved artist, originally from California. She now resides in upstate New York, where she teaches and canoes with her poodle, Fufu. Bustamante’s at times precarious and radically vulnerable work encompasses performance art, video installation, visual art, filmmaking, and writing. Currently, Bustamante holds the position of Associate Professor of New Media and Live Art at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Nicolás Dumit Estévez (USA/Dominican Republic) works mainly in performance art and experiences where life and art often overlap. He has exhibited and performed extensively in the U.S. as well as internationally. Born in Santiago de los Treinta Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Estévez lives and works in the South Bronx.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The Muses is a cabaret collage by Alina Troyano, the writer and creator of the Carmelita Tropicana persona––described in the eighties as a 'Carmen Miranda cloaked in dangerous fruits.' The Muses explores the creation of this persona, examining icons/iconoclasts Sor Juana, a 17th century Mexican poet/nun, and Marlene Dietrich, a 20th century German-born actor/cabaret singer.
[BIO] Alina Troyano (a.k.a.Carmelita Tropicana) is a Cuban-born performance artist, playwright, and actor who has presented work internationally, from el Museo del Barrio in NYC to Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Carmelita Tropicana's trasnocheo cabaret performance is a retelling of Memorias de la Revolucion, with Sor Juana poems and a German/English/Spanish song medley.
[BIO] Alina Troyano (a.k.a.Carmelita Tropicana) is a Cuban-born performance artist, playwright, and actor who has presented work internationally, from el Museo del Barrio in NYC to Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. Her book I, Carmelita Tropicana: Performing Between Cultures includes plays, monologues, performance art pieces, and short stories.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Charles Rice González reads from his novel Chulito: the story of a tough, hip-hop loving young man coming out in the South Bronx and the impact that it has on his neighborhood. It is also a story about the transformative power of love. In this trasnocheo performance, González reads from one of Chulito's dream sequences.
[BIO] Born in Puerto Rico and reared in the Bronx, Charles Rice-González is a writer, long-time community and LGBT activist, the co-founder of BAAD! The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, and a Distinguished Lecturer at Hostos Community College - CUNY. He received an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from Goddard College.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

'Luis Antonio - Gabriela,' by Companhia Mungunzá de Teatro, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute  of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary -, in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES |ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex ‘passions’ that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present—fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others. 

The scenic documentary Luis Antonio - Gabriela begins in 1953 with the birth of Luis Antonio who spent his childhood, adolescence, and part of his youth in Santos before leaving for Spain. The show was created from testimonies of the actor and director, Nelson Baskerville, to his sister Maria Cristina, his stepmother Doracy, and Serginho, a hairdresser in Santos and friend to Luis Antonio. The story ends in 2006, the year of his death in Bilbao, where he had lived until then as Gabriela.

Companhia Mungunzá de Teatro was created in São Paulo in 2006 by from a newly formed group of actors motivated to deepen techniques learned in school in order to develop a detailed study of Brecht’s Epic Theatre as well as other contemporary dramatic languages. They have participated in diverse festivals in Brazil, winning 26 awards in various categories. www.ciamungunza.com.br

Dozens of male and female executives, dressed in business attire, carrying suitcases, bags, cell phones and documents, covered in mud, blindfolded, walk very slowly, blending in with passers-by, destabilizing the daily flow of the city’s financial and political center. Blind seeks to politically intervene in the city and provoke different readings.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond.What options for political and economic justice do people have when the electoral process has been violated or corrupted, the media sequestered in the hands of power-brokers, and official institutions cannot adjudicate in a way that is seen as transparent and legitimate? In light of this dismal state of affairs, this keynote lecture explores the resurgence and even centrality of the body in politics. As political parties fail to represent their constituencies, people are (re)learning how to represent themselves.
[BIO] Diana Taylor is University Professor of Performance Studies and Spanish at NYU.  She is the author of Theatre of Crisis: Drama and Politics in Latin America (1991), Disappearing Acts: Spectacles of Gender and Nationalism in Argentina's 'Dirty War', Duke U.P., 1997, and The Archive and the Repertoire: Performing Cultural Memory in the Americas (Duke U.P., 2003).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

'Voodoo Doll' Or What If Haiti Were a Woman: On ti Travay sou 21 Pwen or An Alter(ed)native in Something Other than Fiction,' by Gina Ulysse, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute  of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary -, in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES |ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex ‘passions’ that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present—fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others. 

An avant-garde meditation on coercion and consent inspired by Gédé – the Haitian Vodou spirit of life and death - that weaves moments in Haiti’s geopolitical history with responses to Gina Ulysse's retelling of that history. 

Gina Ulysse was trained as a cultural anthropologist, and she is also a poet/performer and multi-media artist. She deploys spoken word to both explore and push the blurred border zones between ethnography and performance. Ulysse weaves history, statistics, personal narrative, theory, with Vodou chants to address issues of social (in)justice, intersectional identities, spirituality and the dehumanization of Haitians and other marked bodies. http://www.ginaathenaulysse.com/

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
'Un ser dicho, para ser el nombre,' by Gonzalo Rabanal, was presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute  of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary -, in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES |ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex ‘passions’ that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present—fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others. 

This work puts word and writing in relationship to each other as a violent act, by a man who never learned to read and write. The story tells of his desire to understand the spoken word. The son writes in the voice of his father and the father does the same, but on the body of the son, simultaneously: ‘The body, the father, and the son, like the stigma of not knowing.’

Gonzalo Rabanal studied Audio Visual Communication at the ARCOS Institute, where he began to develop a way of working that projects from individual to collective, opening up space for an expressive multiplicity. In 1989 he received a grant from the ANDES Foundation and in 2010 another from the Ford Foundation. He is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Visual Art at the Pontificia Universidad Católica in Chile. http://rabanalgonzalo.blogspot.com/

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

Fragments of 'Monólogo de Culo, Dale Papito, y La Chupada Antiimperialista,' by Nadia Michelle Granados, La Fulminante, were presented as a part of the 8th International Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute  of Performance and Politics. This Encuentro was held in January of 2013 - the year of Hemi’s 15th anniversary -, in São Paulo, Brazil, under the title CITIES | BODIES |ACTION: The Politics of Passion in the Americas. This event brought together activism, scholarship, and art towards the exploration of urban sites as areas of coexistence, conflict, and collaboration. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The vast array of performances, exhibits, roundtables, workshops, lectures and work groups of this Encuentro were particularly interested in the ways in which bodies both interpellate and are interpellated, mobilize and are mobilized, by and around the diverse and complex ‘passions’ that are so defining of our globalized and mediatized present—fear, hatred, disenchantment, hope and faith, among others. 

Nadia Michelle Granados performs live re-creations of audiovisual materials, playing with  obscene language, sexual material, and emancipatory content. She touches on themes related to globalization, the anti-imperialist struggle, and against the model of power relations imposed by the machismo that is so ingrained in Latin America.

Nadia Michelle Granados, La Fulminante, is a Colombian artist interested in the arts of space, movement, and the body such as video, pornography, magic, installation, and performance. Her work is characterized by the resignification of content extracted from mass media, mixed with themes related to the antiglobalization struggle. www.lafulminante.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS]: The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Santiasco: Urban Memory Graft is a performative dialogue between fragments of testimony made by migrant women in Santiago and the body of the performer, as a way of creating a 'corporamic' view of immigration in Santiago.
[BIO] María José Contreras Lorenzini is a performer and Doctor of Body Language and Psychology. Her work is comprised of creation and theoretical research on the expressive possibilities of the performative body. She is a member of La Diferencia, a collective that has created a series of performances in response to the Daniel Zamudio controversy.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Economusic: Keeping Score is a live performance in which economic data from our everyday lives and the ongoing global crisis are converted into absurd neoDadaist music. This darkly playful and highly (audience-)participatory event takes note of and makes notes from falling wages, rising sea levels, and other indicators of our suffering and success.
[BIO] L. M. Bogad writes, performs, and strategizes with mischievous artists such as the Agit-Pop, Yes Men, and La Pocha Nostra. He is co-founder of the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army. His performances have dealt with topics such as the Egyptian revolution, the Haymarket Square Riot, the FBI’s COINTELPRO activities, the Pinochet coup in Chile, and global climate chaos.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Ways to Play (Formas de brincar) considers the aesthetic and disciplinary objectification of the human body by exploring the street as a field for an old popular game in Brazil: the Cinco Marias. In contemporary society, we succumb to the seduction of borrowed attitudes, in a kind of non-authenticity, in fragments of attitudes chosen almost unconsciously from a range of dominant stereotypes.
[BIO] ERRO Grupo is well-known in Brazil for the multidisciplinary urban interventionism that they have been developing since 2001. The group makes street theater and urban interventions that deal with risk, violence, and peripheral performance––inserting art into daily life as a political praxis.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Clad in skimpy Speedos, Estévez embodies Machete––a male vedette who dances night after night during the Encuentro, and whose marathon-like action asks: the more Machete dances, what? The more Latin America dances, what? The more one watches Latin America dance, what? Cockiness and humor collide in this pulsating endurance piece, which flirts with the risks of succumbing to exhaustion.
[BIO] Nicolás Dumit Estévez works mainly in performance art, as well as in contexts where life and art overlap. He has exhibited and performed extensively in the U.S. as well as internationally. Born in Santiago de Lostreinta Caballeros, (Dominican Republic), Estévez currently lives and works in the South Bronx.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Mestizo Orpheus tells of the return of a politician to his past and his connection to military dictatorship. A phone call about the disinterment of the body of his companion Eurydice places Orpheus in contact with a past that he has tried to forget. Responding to conflict, this text is inspired by the Orphic myths and incoporates multilple characters from different epochs, who each help guide Orpheus in his descent into hell.
[BIO] Núcleo Bartolomeu de Depoimentos works with language at the union of hip hop and epic theatre to create hip-hop theatre, a pioneering concept in Brazil that opens numerous possibilities and fields of action, dialoguing with the trends and diversity of urban culture.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The recent capitalist development in Brazil has led to the institutionalization of cultural production. Research in the arts, which had previously worked against the grain of dominant logics, is now frequently a conformist site of alternative inclusion within capital’s ideological order. Group Theater in São Paulo and the Commodification of Culture explores how dissonant voices in this process––including those of some São Paulo theater groups––are now looking for critical ways to confront the depoliticization and commodification that has been imposed by and is a result of the bare necessities of survival.
[BIO] Sérgio de Carvalho is playwright and director of Companhia do Latão, a São Paulo theater group. He is also Professor of playwriting and criticism at the Universidade de São Paulo. He is the editor of Vintém and Traulito, and author of Atuação Crítica and Introdução ao Teatro Dialético (2009). His plays include O Nome do Sujeito (1998), O Círculo de Giz Caucasiano (2006) and Ópera dos Vivos (2010).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. From a micropolitical perspective, the unconscious repression of the knowing-body is the greatest violence of the colonial enterprise. This keynote lecture examines how this violence is in the marrow of the modern Western culture that continues to structure our lives. Today, the toxic effects of this unconscious repression have reached a critical point, generating the vast crisis in which we are now immersed. In order to return to the knowing-body––free from the effects of trauma––it is necessary that we resist the actual state of things. This is not a matter of futurology, for signs of this return are emerging throughout the 'Global South'––a South that is multiple and whose borders are not geographically limited. These signs of return are blasts of oxygen at points where thought has been asphyxiated––a tireless redrawing of landscapes, an endless work. Is this the real political potency of art?
[BIO] Suely Rolnik is a psychoanalyst, arts/culture critic, and curator. She is Professor at the PUCP-SP (PhD in Clinical Psychology) and faculty member of the independent study program (PEI) at the Museo d’Art Contemporani in Barcelona (MacBa).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. How did a feminist film scholar trained in post-structuralist theory end up running a software lab? Answering this question, this keynote lecture engages various histories in the development of computational systems in order to argue that more humanities scholars should take seriously issues in the design and implementation of software systems.
[BIO] Tara McPherson teaches courses in the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts. She authored the award-winning Reconstructing Dixie: Race, Gender and Nostalgia in the Imagined South (2003). Her new media research focuses on issues of convergence, gender, race, and representation, as well as upon the development of new tools and paradigms for digital publishing. She is the Founding Editor of Vectors and a Co-editor of the International Journal of Learning and Media.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. 'Potestad' came out of the post-graduate research of two professors (an actor and a director) around the theme of psychic states and the question of political identities during Argentina’s dictatorship. The performance seek to provoke memories in a country that has few memories.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Courage II is a theater piece exploring urban violence in a country without a declared war, but whose citizens are nevertheless plagued by a paranoia generated by the security sector. This sector forcibly represses the memory of a militarized nation that has been involved in multiple wars, each financed by the arms market. The performance explores our own violence within this global context.
[BIO] Teresa Hernández is a theater artist with 25 years of experience in both research and practice at the intersections of dance, theater, and performance. Searching for new ways of making, narrating, and being on stage, she conducts comprehensive studies of the body, space, and text. Her work engages identity as a shifting terrain; art and its established canon; and violence and power with its mutiple faces and branches.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. This performatic demonstration is inspired by the questions that emerge during the creation of a performance of Antígona. What creative process must an actor undergo in order to arrive at the performance? How does she construct a stage language in order to bring the performance to life? How do the director and the actor enter into dialogue?
[BIO] Teresa Ralli is a founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani––her main space of experimentation and creation. She is an actress and director who researches both voice and body. She is also a Professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, where she received a degree in Communications and a graduate degree (for a distinguished career) in Theatre Arts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The performance Where? Action #2 uses a poetic form in order to provoke reflections on the recent past––particularly the still-open wounds caused by the military dictatorship in Brazil. This action joins the movement of thousands of Brazilians who are demanding that the Federal Government continue to investigate the fate of those victims who were disappeared during the military regime.
[BIO] Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz is a theater group that was founded in 1978 and was inspired by a desire for the radical renewal of theater language. Their three main areas of work are: Street Theater (born out of political protest); Experience Theater (the production of a shared experience); and artistic-pedagogical work. They have also opened up a new space for theater research: the Terreira da Tribo, that operates as a popular theater school.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond.
[BIOS] Álvaro Villalobos (Colombia/México) holds a Master of Visual Arts from the Universidad Autónoma (México) and from the Facultad de Artes ASAB (Bogotá). His work engages social and political problems through performances, videos, installations, and photography. He is currently a professor at UNAM and UAEMéx in Mexico.

Bel Borba (Brazil), known as 'The People’s Picasso,' has spread his artwork throughout the 500-year-old urban landscape for thirty-five years. In 2012, he participated in the New York City’s Crossing the Line Festival, sponsored by the French Institute/Alliance Française and the Hemispheric Institute, where he created Diário--a collaboration with Burt Sun and Andr Contantini.

Diana/Daf/Collazos (Peru) is a multidisciplinary artist and independent cultural producer. Her work centers around performance, urban interventions, video, and installation. She is founder and manager of elgalpon.espacio Cultural Association, a space for the creation and dissemination of multidisciplinary artistic projects.

Nadia Granados (a.k.a. La Fulminante) is a Colombian artist interested in the arts of space, movement, and the body such as video, pornography, magic, installation, and performance. Her work is characterized by the resignification of content extracted from mass media, mixed with themes related to the antiglobalization struggle.

Coletivo de Performance Heróis do Cotidiano (Brazil) has been active for three years in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, researching the performative drama of the hero and the sacrifice of the poor in contemporary times. They believe in the poetic use of the city, rather than the strictly functional. Dressed as superheroes, the performers––under the direction of Gilson Motta and Tania Alice––create urban interventions combining theater, visual arts, dance, and political activism.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The Poetics of Grief explores how citizens are questioned and challenged through and by symbolic interventions in public space. The latter call attention to the dangers of forgetting crucial past events––events that move us away from triumphalism and insist, over and over again, on the need to continue processing the worst of the past. In this lecture, Vich analyzes three public interventions performed in contemporary Peru, which each reopened discussions concerning political violence.
[BIO] Víctor Vich holds a doctorate in Latin American Literature from Georgetown University. In 2007, he was an invited professor at Harvard University and in 2009, he won a Guggenheim grant. He is currently coordinator of the Masters program in Cultural Studies at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú and a principal researcher at the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos (IEP).

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. Requiem for a Lost Land is a performative intervention that uses ritual to remember the murders committed during 'The War on Drugs' implemented by the Mexican government. Requiem uses performance as a coroner’s knife to open the discourse of death put forth by those in power under the guise of 'national security.'
[BIO] Violeta Luna is a performance artist and activist whose work explores the relationship between theater, performance art, and community engagement. She uses her body as a territory for questioning and commenting on socio-political phenomena. Luna obtained her graduate degree in Acting from the Centro Universitario de Teatro (UNAM) and La Casa del Teatro. She is currently an associate artist in performance collectives La Pocha Nostra and Secos & Mojados.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The 8th Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute sought to examine the broad intersections between urban space, performance and political/artistic action in the Americas. From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. 'Dona Mariana' is a performance about how deities and religious practices travel across borders, harboring a transformative power of sensing, healing, and sharing through the body. Being in-between corporeality, the audio waves of a radio soap opera, and difussed images on a screen, Zeca Ligiéro invokes the presence of Dona Mariana. Thus, this performance becomes a ritualistic, almost sacred, act of sharing.  
[BIO] Zeca Ligiéro is Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro. Since 1998, he coordinates the Center for the Study of Afro-Amerindian Performances–NEPAA. He has published Corpo a corpo: estudos das performance brasileiras (2011), Performance Afro-Ameríndia (2007); Carmen Miranda: uma performance afro-brasileira (2006), and Malandro divino: a vida e a lenda de Zé Pelintra (2004), among others.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
Interview with Laura Levin, conducted Mark Matusoff. This interview is a part of a series curated by the Hemispheric Institute, articulated around the question 'What is Performance Studies?' The series aims to provide a multifaceted approach to the often difficult task of defining the coordinates of both a field of academic study as well as a lens through which to assess and document cultural practice and embodied behavior. The contingent definitions documented in this series are based on the groundbreaking experiences and the scholarly endeavors of renowned figures in contemporary performance studies and practice.

Laura Levin is a performance theorist whose research focuses on contemporary theatre and performance art, performing gender and sexuality, site-specific and urban performance, and intermediality in performance.  She is Editor-in-Chief of Canadian Theatre Review and has edited a number of collections: an issue of Theatre Research in Canada on Space and Subjectivity in Performance; a CTR issue on Performance Art; an issue of Performance Research on Performing Publics, Conversations Across Borders (Seagull Books, 2011); and Theatre and Performance in Toronto (Playwrights Canada Press, 2011). Her current research, which focuses on gender, performance, and space, appears in several edited volumes including Judith Thompson (ed. Ric Knowles) and Space and the Geographies of Canadian Theatre (ed. Michael McKinnie), and Performance and the City (eds. Kim Solga, DJ Hopkins, and Shelley Orr). She has worked as a director and dramaturg on a number of productions in North America and several practice-based research projects that investigate intersections of performance, geography, and digital technologies. In 2008, Laura Levin was awarded a SSHRC Standard Grant for ‘The Canadian Performance Studies Project,’ the first major research study to theorize and map the field of performance studies as it has emerged in Canada. As part of this project, she chaired the annual Performance Studies International conference, which was held in Canada for the first time in June 2010. She is currently a co-investigator for the Canadian Consortium on Performance and Politics in the Americas, a SSHRC-funded partnership between NYU’s Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics and a network of performance researchers from Canadian universities.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Performance artist and playwright Dan Fishback works out some of his anxieties about queer history, gay representation, male protagonism, and the limits of the queer imagination in this vaguely academic (but not really) captial-T 'Talk,' theoretically leading toward some thoughts (and hopefully some revelations) about queer ennui, queer depression, and how the adult queer universe can strategize to prevent queer teenage suicide. Along the way, he discusses Lady Gaga, prostalgia (pro-active nostalgia), David Halperin's How to Be Gay, and Fishback's own book-in-progress, Thirtynothing, based on his solo performance of the same name. Thirtynothing explores the legacy of gay artists who died of AIDS in the 80s and 90s, and examines the generation gap between today's young gay men and the gay men who lived through the early years of the AIDS crisis.
[BIO] Dan Fishback has been writing and performing in New York City since 2003. Major works include The Material World (2012), thirtynothing (2011) and You Will Experience Silence (2009), all directed by Stephen Brackett at Dixon Place. Fishback has received grants from the Franklin Furnace Fund (2010) and the Six Points Fellowship for Emerging Jewish Artists (2007-2009).  He is also the director of the Helix Queer Performance Network, a collaboration between La MaMa Experimental Theater Club, the Hemispheric Institute of Performance & Politics, and BAX/Brooklyn Arts Exchange and he curates a wide variety of public programming, including the annual performance series La MaMa's SQUIRTS. Fishback frequently teaches workshops on performance composition and queer performance culture at BAX/Brooklyn Arts Exchange and other institutions and universities. He blogs at thematerialworld.tumblr.com.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Aristides Vargas and Charo Francés, founding members of Grupo de Teatro Malayerba. In this interview, Vargas and Francés talk about the group’s trajectory, from its origins based on the anguish that comes with the exile. They explain that finding a theatrical common territory offers both a sense of belonging and a permanent precarity, from where they have constantly reinvented themselves. Having fled from the horrors of a dictatorship, Malayerba emerged as a collective effort to follow the radical principle of equality in difference, and performing politics through the act of reinstating communal ties. Their aesthetics and political work is also related to their international theater labs - a site of communal culture and a space for constant investigation, where Malayerba ‘does not teach theater, but teaches how to learn theater.’
[BIO] Grupo de Teatro Malayerba was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain. From the start, Malayerba included actors with various backgrounds and nationalities, invested in the exploration of the rich cultural diversity and complex history of Ecuador, as well as issues of migration, exile, political violence and individual and collective memory. With over 35 years of ongoing theater practice and more than 20 plays performed locally and internationally for a diverse audience, Malayerba is committed to theater pedagogy and experimentation, artistic collaboration, and community building. They have represented Ecuador in national and international theater festivals; they have also collaborated with theater groups within Ecuador and in other countries, and performed for both film and television, while engaging in community work in Quito. In 1989 the group created the Laboratorio Malayerba, committed to the training of generations of young Ecuadorian actors and to an ongoing investigation of theories and practices of experimental theater. In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes.In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] This documentary features the work that Professor Rosa Luisa Márquez has developed in the University of Puerto Rico with students from different artistic disciplines. Professor Márquez has taught her Creative Dramatics class, ‘Leaps and Bounds’ (Brincos y Saltos), since 1979, collecting techniques by fellow Latin American theatre artists. Inspired by Augusto Boal’s words, ‘Being human is being an artist,’ Professor Márquez places playing and games at the center of a theatrical discipline based on trust, sharing, and enjoyment. ‘Brincos y Saltos’ offers 10 sessions and a bonus round as a ‘model kit’ for artists and educators who want to learn games, warm-up exercises, and theatrical techniques that explore the sensoriality of the body, its relationship with the power of words, and the path from rehearsals to performing on stage. Professor Márquez explains the meaning of each session, and shares testimonies and interviews with theatre artists and educators from different parts of the world, including Augusto Boal, Julian Boal, Javier Cardona, Antonio Martorell, Vivian Martínez Tabares, Teresa Ralli, Miguel Rubio Zapata, Charo Francés, and Arístides Vargas, among others. Conceived as a pedagogical resource, ‘Brincos y Saltos’ also includes some excerpts of her plays, as well as some vignettes and choreographies by representative Latin American theatre artists.


[BIO] Rosa Luisa Márquez is a Puerto Rican theater artist and pedagogue; she specializes in contemporary theater. Rosa Luisa started her teaching career at the theater department of the University of Puerto Rico in 1978. She developed the current curriculum of Drama Activities, which she teaches in her workshops at schools, prisons, rehab centers, women's shelters and community centers. Her directing projects include ‘Romeo(s) y Julieta(s),’ ‘Historias para ser Contadas,’ ‘La Leyenda del Cemí,’ ‘Procesión,’ ‘Waiting for Godot,’ ‘Jardín de Pulpos,’ ‘Absurdos en Soledad,’ ‘El León y la Joya,’ among others.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Miguel Rubio Zapata, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Miguel Rubio talks about creación colectiva (collective creation) in Latin America. He points out that creación colectiva is not a theater method, but an attitude that emerged from the stage as a rebellion against the socio-political crises that devastated the continent in the late 60s and early 70s. Rubio gives details about key encounters between Latin American theater directors like Santiago García and Enrique Buenaventura, and how this influenced in Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani’s artistic work. He also explains the role that European artists and thinkers like Bertolt Brecht and Eugenio Barba played in the development of new aesthetic and political proposals in Latin American theater. Rubio notes that, in present times, theater is an interdisciplinary experience, where the spectator also has a prominent, active role. 
[BIO] Miguel Rubio Zapata  is a director, theater researcher, and founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani. His most recent directions include: Con-cierto Olvido (2010); El último ensayo (2008); Sin Título-técnica mixta (2004); Hecho en Perú-Vitrinas para un Museo de la Memoria (2001).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] Interview with Miguel Rubio Zapata, conducted by Diana Taylor, founding director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In this interview, Miguel Rubio talks about the crisis of representation related to the atrocities inflicted by political violence during the internal armed conflict in Peru (1980-2000). Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani worked closely with the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC organized the public hearings where the testimonies of the survivors revealed the extremes of violence performed by terrorist groups and the State alike. The group then asked: what can Yuyachkani, and what can theatre do in times of violence, death, and disappearance? These events marked a transformation in Yuyachkani’s work, that now considers its performances as being in-between presence and representation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Artist Nicolás Dumit Estévez’s stay in Banner, Wyoming in
the spring of 2008  yielded the plot for a five-minute video, shot on
location in a town of forty inhabitants and a thousand private acres.
Employing common images of the West such as cowboys and Indians, the gold
rush, saloons, and outlaws, the American West is even presently viewed as a
wide expanse ready for the taking. In this playful look at the US mythology
of the wild, wild West, the outsider protagonist attempts to get in touch
with his inner cowboy. However, the landscape reveals itself as a place out
of reach and the 21st century cowboy must come face-to-face with a
countryside owned by multi-national energy corporations as the ultimate
product of US capitalist ideals of private property: ‘Welcome to Wyoming,
Inc.’ 

[BIO] Nicolás Dumit Estévez is an interdisciplinary artist working mainly
in performance art and art-and-life experiences. He has exhibited and
performed extensively in the US as well as internationally at venues such

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Modeled after El Camino de Compostela in Spain, artist Nicolás
Dumit Estévez embarks on a series of seven pilgrimages, from Lower
Manhattan to seven different museums on foot. With a heavy load of donated
art publications strapped to his back, the artist reverses the relationship
between art and religion with religion becoming a tool in the service of
art. The artist has a large amount of donated art publications strapped to
his back for a trip that took him from Lower Manhattan to East Harlem. El
Museo del Barrio's Director Julián Zugazagoitia commemorates the
performance by signing the artist's passport and Martha Wilson performs
departed blessings.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This video documentation features a performance that takes place
after the artist leaves a seven-day retreat into a monastery where he
devoted himself to the nocturnal adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament,
prayer, and refrained from verbal language and communication with the
outside world. Upon exiting the monastery he journeys on foot, along with
invited friends and guests, to the Bronx Academy of Art and Dance where he
breaks his vow of silence for a Question and Answer session. During the
Q&A, the artist promises to only speak of nocturns once a year for seven
consecutive years, 2008-2014 and to never speak of nocturns after the
seventh year, thereby relying on the audience to spread information by
word-of-mouth, and archiving the experience in a purely oral
format.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Augusto Boal gives a lecture at Brooklyn College on the theater of the oppressed. He states, “The theatre that I do is to show that every human being uses the same languages as the actor on stage (passion, movements, and costumes depending on the scenery), but the actor has consciousness of it.” He touches on the inevitability of “doing” theatre: that in fact once we learn to speak the language of theater, it can be rehearsed in real life in order to “analyze possibilities.” Lastly, in relation to the spectator, Boal argues that they should not be passive, but active and transgressive, seeking to interfere and modify the performance that is presented to them.  

[BIO] Augusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination. In this workshop and keynote address, celebrated in the context of in the context of the first Encuentro of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2000, Boal talks about the history and coordinates of the Theater of the Oppressed. He also shares with the participants some of the ludic exercises included in Games for Actors and Non-Actors. The workshop ends with a demonstration of Forum Theater, with performances by two groups linked to the Centro de Teatro do Oprimido: Grupo Artimanha (on issues of AIDS and homosexuality) and Grupo Panela de Oppresão (on the forced displacement of disempowered, marginalized communities).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] In this second part of Augusto Boal's workshop at Brooklyn College, Boal asks groups of five to present images of oppression, with 41 groups participating in total. Once this collection of images of oppression are presented, Boal asks if the participants identify themselves with the characters. He has them participate in an exercise of interaction involving movement, stillness, speaking, and silence.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

The Brooklyn College series features video material of two full days of workshop with Augusto Boal in 1988. This is a video documentation of the second day of workshop, dedicated mostly to Forum Theatre practices. Augusto Boal leads general exercises and invites participants to think about how to apply Theatre of the Oppressed techniques in a classroom setting. This video material also includes discussions and exercises on transgression.

Augusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed.  Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled.  His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed. 
The Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems.  The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Enabling Theatre is a series of Theatre of the Oppressed Workshops for people with disabilities. This 2003 two-day workshop in Hebden Bridge is divided into two parts, one for each day. During the first day, Boal explains that the goal of the workshop is to enable the participants and to give them tools for the creation of their own plays, but also for them to learn the fundamentals of the Theatre of the Oppressed. Participants engage in several general exercises developed by Augusto Boal that can be found in his book Theatre of the Oppressed: Games for Actors and Non-Actors.
During the second day of workshops they continue practicing general exercises that culminate in Forum Theatre practices, where they replace the protagonist and discuss new alternatives for problem solving.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Documentation of a full-day workshop of the Theatre of the Oppressed dedicated to women. This documentation is divided into two parts. During the first part of this workshop, participants engage in several general exercises developed by Augusto Boal that can be found in his book Theatre of the Oppressed: Games for Actors and Non-Actors. Participants also learn more about Augusto Boal’s work with Arena Theatre and his work outside of Brazil.
 
During a brief interview, Boal explains more about the development of the Theatre of the Oppressed (from the 60s to the 80s), the difference between oppression in Latin America and Europe, and how the Theatre of the Oppressed can be used to help women’s rights.

During the second part of this workshop, participants engage in Image Theatre exercises, in which they discuss and rethink oppression scenes that they develop throughout the exercises.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
In this Lecture from 1992, part of the ATHE Conference, Augusto Boal talks about his journey as a director and the trajectory of the Theatre of the Oppressed. Boal discusses the different kind of oppression he encountered in Europe and how he came to develop the Rainbow of Desire technique - exercises based on the internalization of oppression, ‘the cop in the head.’ During this lecture Augusto Boal presents and discusses three drawings - ‘What is Theatre?’; ‘What is a Human Being?’; and ‘What is an Actor?’ - as a way to emphasize the Theatre of the Oppressed as a methodology of exercises, games, images, and techniques that restore human capacity to do, to be theatre.

Augusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed.  Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled.  His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed. 
The Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems.  The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
In this Lecture at the Martin Luther King Center in 2000, Augusto Boal gives an overview of the trajectory of the Theatre of the Oppressed techniques from ‘Newspaper Theatre’ to the ‘Rainbow of Desire’. During this lecture, Boal also gives some hands-on activities leading a few Forum Theatre exercises and several general exercises that can be found in his book Theatre of the Oppressed: Games for Actors and Non-Actors. 

Augusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
FITO is the International Festival of the Theatre of the Oppressed, where groups from all over the world met in Rio de Janeiro to perform their plays created with the methods of the Theatre of the Oppressed (Image, Invisible, Forum, and Legislative Theatre). 

In this documentation from the VII FITO, we witness the first day of the festival where Augusto Boal introduces the groups that will be performing. Also, in this particular year (1993), the Theatre of the Oppressed was celebrating 22 years and a series of scenes from the trajectory of the Theatre of the Oppressed were performed, including: ‘Revolução na América do Sul’(1959); ‘O Tio Patinhas e a pílula’(1968); ‘Verde que te quero Verde’(1968); ‘A Concreção da Abstração’(1971); and ‘Torquemada’(1971).

Augusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed.  Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled.  His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] The play ‘Murro em Ponta de Faca’ was written by Boal in 1971, during his exile. It is a story of the military dictatorship in Brazil and in Latin America. The story shows a group of exiled Brazilians that go through the social and individual experience of living, against their will, in a different homeland - in this case Chile, Argentina, and France. The group is formed by three couples of different social classes and ideologies (intellectuals, workers, and bourgeois) who are forced to live in the same space and face their differences and lack of freedom. The play deals with broad issues of exile, resulting in exclusion, denial, control, and intolerance, but also the fight for affirmation and resistance. 

[BIO] Augusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical 
director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the 
most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author 
of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of 
Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for 
Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, 
a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education 
movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. 
Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims 
at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order 
to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that 
engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he 
who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to 
the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an 
instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all 
forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Dorfman’s play addresses the institutionalized violence of the military dictatorships which used torture as a tool for control and coercion, deeply marking the people of Latin America and their history. The play features three characters connected by political repression and torture: a husband, a wife who has been tortured, and an alleged torturer. Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz’s staging continues their research into the teatro de vivência, and demonstrates the anguish experienced by Brazilians, Chileans, and all Latin Americans who lived through the late twentieth century, with the end of the military regimes: How can repressors and repressed live on the same earth, share a same table? How to heal a country traumatized by fear? The play explores not only the themes of torture, justice, fear, and healing, it also raises a series of questions: How to tell the truth if the mask we wear is identical to our face? How can we tell if our memory is saving or deceiving us? How to keep our innocence in an evil and corrupt world? Can we forgive those who have perpetrated terrible damage upon us?

[BIO] Based in Porto Alegre, The Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz was born in 1978 out of a desire for a radical renovation of the language of theatre. During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Teon is a ritual, a prayer for the millions of indigenous people who have been killed all across the Americas. The communal life, the religiosity, the contact with the white man, disease, slavery, and the genocide of indigenous culture are shown in a sequence of eight tableaus. A procession walks by slowly, following the rhythm of a drum. The performance begins with a ritual preparation. In a circle, the indigenous people share bread and water, they sing and dance with war cries. The ceremony is interrupted by the arrival of an indigenous person in chains. The group releases him, but he falls at the feet of his companions. The tribe lets out a cry of pain, and with their bodies they form a totem. The sound of a bomb exploding is heard. The totems fall apart, the indigenous people are dead. In the middle of the circle, a single indigenous woman survives, yet three people come from the audience and surround the dead bodies with chains. The destruction is complete. The old indigenous woman sets her own body on fire. Combining masks, costumes, and choreography, the performers become live sculptures involving the audience as in a dream.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
In Fountain Patty Chang stares into a mirror while drinking water from her reflection. To create the visual imagery depicted in the frame, Chang placed a video camera on a 45-degree angle while filming the live performance in her studio. Positioning the camera at this angle changes the plane of the video and also reshapes how viewers see the footage of the performance. Viewers are not aware of this stylistic approach when watching the footage, but instead see a re-purposed view of the live performance that has been displayed vertically in the video. The approaches that Chang takes in Fountain are political in their form as well as content, addressing standards of beauty, representations of Asian women, and the problematics of the male gaze. Fountain was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015. 

Patty Chang’s performative works deal with themes of gender, language, and empathy.  Working predominantly in video, Chang uses the medium to document her performances, often utilizing the camera’s potential to misrepresent. Her works often challenge viewers’ perceptions of what they see, frequently creating visual sleights of hand that highlight fantastical representations of ‘Asia.’  Chang’s work has been exhibited nationwide and internationally at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the New Museum in New York; the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the Hamburg Kunstverein in Hamburg, Germany; and the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. She was nominated for the Hugo Boss Prize in 2008, named the Guna S. Mundheim Fellow of Visual Arts at the American Academy in Berlin in 2009, and a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014. www.pattychang.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
A rare interview with Bob Flanagan and Sheree Rose conducted by Franklin Furnace Founding Director Martha Wilson and her partner, Vince Bruns. Set in the exhibit Visiting Hours: An Installation by Bob Flanagan in collaboration with Sheree Rose at the New Museum, the interview details the duo’s performance art practice. Throughout, Flanagan and Rose discuss the sexual politics of art; pain as an art medium; the gaze of receiving and witnessing pain; art as an erotic gesture; and the spiritual in art. These topics are further discussed in the larger context of performance art history, referencing the erotic work of Ron Athey and Annie Sprinkle in relationship to Flanagan’s performances with Rose.

Bob Flanagan and Sheree Rose began their artistic collaboration in the late 1980’s Los Angeles club and art scenes. Their performance, photography, and video work integrates elements of BDSM, which culminated in the exhibit ‘Visiting Hours’ at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and at the New Museum. After Flanagan’s death to cystic fibrosis in 1996, Rose continued to make artwork honoring Flanagan’s legacy and their collaboration. Rose made contributions to the documentary, ‘Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist,’ which premiered at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded a Special Jury Prize.  She was commissioned by Japan to produce ‘Boballoon,’ a 20-foot inflatable statue of Flanagan that was exhibited at Big Space in Tokyo. Rose shows her photography at international galleries, including the Coagula in Los Angeles, Tate Modern in Liverpool, and Jeu de Paume in Paris, and has presented multiple performances at Highways Performance Space and Gallery in Santa Monica. Long after Flanagan’s death, his artwork with Rose continues to be a model for artists dealing with illness and death.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
Franklin Furnace at Pseudo Programs, Inc. marked the first season of Franklin Furnace's collaboration with Pseudo Online Network. Franklin Furnace’s decision to move from a physical space to a virtual one was prompted by the impact of the culture wars on artistic freedom in the United States. Despite the effort to maintain other physical spaces in Downtown New York, Franklin Furnace’s board determined that access to freedom of expression and a broader audience for emerging artists through new media would be the prime focus of the arts organization. The virtual turn for Franklin Furnace was a radical move that marked the organization’s shift from exhibiting avant-garde work in physical spaces to online realms. Through this gesture, Franklin Furnace investigated the democratic landscape of the Internet as a censorship free space to present political art. Featured presenters in this video recording of the live netcast on The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com) via Pseudo Programs, Inc. include Halona Hilbertz, Bingo Gazingo, Patricia Hoffbauer, Jon Keith, Jason E. Bowman, Kali Lela Colton, Nora York, Anna Mosby Coleman, Lenora Champagne, and Alvin Eng with Yoav Gal.

Franklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas. The organization has developed a place in art history for artists’ books, temporary installation art, and performance art. www.franklinfurnace.org

Concealed behind gorilla masks, the Guerrilla Girls take on the names of dead women artists—Claude Cahun, Julia de Burgos, Audre Lorde, and Ana Mendieta, among others—as a feminist gesture to counter the erasure of their work by cultural and artistic institutions. Furthermore, the video includes footage of Guerrilla Girls street actions targeting museums and galleries that fail to include women artists in their exhibitions and collections.  Several women artists are listed at the end of Secret Identities as a political act to re-inscribe their names into art history, which has otherwise failed to include or recognize such contributions to art practice and discourse.

The Guerilla Girls are an anonymous women's collective that take on the names of dead women artists as pseudonyms for interventions.  Concealed behind gorilla masks in action, the Guerilla Girls use various tactics to intervene in art, culture, and politics. Through the production of printed materials, publications, and performance actions, the Guerilla Girls expose political matters, convey information, and provoke discussions in public contexts.  Notorious for exposing the exclusion of women artists, the Guerilla Girls have staged interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Venice Biennale, the Centre Pompidou, among other renowned venues. The Guerilla Girls work is presented from feminist and humorist perspectives. www.guerrillagirls.com

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
Holly Hughes investigates the politics of art and democracy in Preaching to the Perverted. She discusses her recent appearance before the U.S.Supreme Court in the case NEA v. Finley (1998).  Hughes, along with Karen Finley, John Fleck, and Tim Miller, were awarded grants by the National Endowment for the Arts that were later revoked for obscenity.  The group of artists, which became known as the NEA Four, filed a case against the National Endowment for the Arts asserting First Amendment and statutory claims. Hughes reenacts scenes from the U.S. Supreme Court trial that she calls ‘theatrical spectacles,’ while noting the larger context of censorship in the arts in the United States. She de-centers national debates surrounding freedom, citizenship, and democracy from a lesbian feminist point of view and asserts her artistic freedom by creating performances that reflect a radical body politic. Hughes’ testimony, alongside those of Finley, Fleck, and Miller, led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in favor of the NEA Four’s case against the National Endowment for the Arts. She further elaborates upon the NEA Four trial and the conservative political climate of the nation during the case in the Q&A session following the performance.  Preaching to the Perverted was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015. 

Holly Hughes is a writer and performer, who began her thespian adventures at the WOW Cafe Theater in the Lower East Side of New York City.  Her work deals with questions of identity and sexual desire, drawing recognition including two Village Obie Awards, a Guggenheim Fellowship, funding from Creative Capital, NYSCA, and the NEA, as well as the ire of the religious right during the culture wars. Hughes’s books include Clit Notes: A Sapphic Sampler (1996), O Solo Homo: The New Queer Performance (1998), Animal Acts: Performing Species Today (2014), and Memories of the Revolution: Ten Years of the WOW Cafe (forthcoming). She is a Professor at the University of Michigan where she founded the BFA in Interarts Performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
Post Porn Modernist chronicles Annie Sprinkle's careers as a sex worker, pro-sex activist, and artist. Sprinkle begins with her transformation from Ellen Steinberg to Annie Sprinkle, an act that prompted her sexual revolution.  In this process of becoming, Sprinkle critiques patriarchal ideals of female  sexuality and second-wave feminist anti-porn agendas. While critical of the male gaze, Sprinkle engages the gesture by posing on her own terms and affirming her sexual pleasure to re-appropriate the gaze throughout the performance. She provides a playful critique of the National Endowment for the Arts, alluding to her exhibit Carnival Knowledge (1984) presented by Franklin Furnace, which was reprimanded by the federal agency for its feminist pornographic content. Sprinkle discusses the labor politics of the sex work industry and her close relationships to clients, some of whom were disabled, lesbian, transgender, or gay men with HIV/AIDS. During the AIDS epidemic, Sprinkle focused her sex work on developing new practices such as the breath orgasm, a technique created with Barbara Carrellas, which allowed those infected with the disease to experience pleasure without having intercourse. This shift in Sprinkle’s work prompted the transformation of Annie into Anya, a persona who embodies the sacred energy of ancient goddess prostitutes.  Post Porn Modernist was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015.

Annie Sprinkle is a prostitute/porn star turned artist/sexologist. She explores sexuality through her unique brand of feminist sex films, writings, artworks, performances, and teachings. Sprinkle has long championed sex worker rights and health care, and was pivotal in the Sex Positive Feminist Movement of the 1980's. She received her BFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City and was the first porn star to earn a Ph.D, which was awarded to her by the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco. For many years, Sprinkle has collaborated with her long time partner, Elizabeth Stephens, an artist and UCSC professor.  Sprinkle and Stephens are active leaders of the Ecosex Movement, where they are committed to making environmental activism more sexy, fun, and diverse through artistic gestures. www.anniesprinkle.org | www.sexecology.org

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
Franklin Furnace Founding Director Martha Wilson discusses the political landscape of the arts organization in the context of the avant-garde and the culture wars in the United States. Wilson situates performance art as a confrontational form that emerged from Futurism, Constructivism, and Dadaism in the early 20th century.  She describes the radical nature of performance art as a medium that transmits conceptual thinking through live actions, as evidenced by the work of Franklin Furnace artists Karen Finley, Annie Sprinkle, and Scarlet O. Wilson explains how the political subject matter embodied by these artists—feminism, pornography, and sexuality—impacted Franklin Furnace as an arts organization in the conservative climate of the culture wars. She notes the consistent attacks by religious right groups on Franklin Furnace that led to defunding from the National Endowment for the Arts, as the organization was accused of presenting obscene art with government funds. Despite the upheaval, Wilson, in true avant-garde fashion, insisted that ‘Until they cart me away in a straightjacket, I am going to continue to present performance art.’ While an advocate for government funding, Wilson is critical of the regulation of content in the arts—a phenomenon that did not manifest in other sectors of public funding at the time. 

Martha Wilson is a pioneering gallery director and feminist artist who creates innovative photographic and video works that explore her female subjectivity. Wilson founded Franklin Furnace in 1976, an artist-run space that champions the exploration, promotion, and preservation of artist books, temporary installation, performance art, as well as online works.  She has been described by New York Times critic Holland Cotter as one of ‘the half-dozen most important people for art in downtown Manhattan in the 1970s.’  Wilson has received fellowships for performance art from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts; Bessie and Obie awards for commitment to artists’ freedom of expression; a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts; a Richard Massey Foundation-White Box Arts and Humanities Award; and an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University. www.marthawilson.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The Hemispheric Institute's 9th Encuentro, held at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, sought to explore the multiple valences of the term MANIFEST! How are performances mobilized and syncretized in civic, community, and cultural contexts to create manifold forms of political expression? How do public, theatrical events produce ‘evidence’ that manifests ideas otherwise invisible, hidden, or unspeakable? What new manifestations, manifestos, festivals, and manifs emerge via our changing visions of political spaces, intellectual arenas, and the everyday street? The 2014 Encuentro invited artists, activists, and scholars to engage with and investigate the aesthetic, social, and choreographic techniques that transform political ideas into collective images, through actions, embodied utterances, and ways of being. Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. Between Menopause and Old Age aims to demystify the horror of old age in an ironic way, inventing a deranged aesthetic and a moral solution for the 'problem of age.' Rocio Boliver hopes that her mockery of this absurd contemporary reality exposes a broken society based on looks, and challenges the ways in which old age has become synonymous with insult.
[BIO] Rocio Boliver (La Congelada de Uva) has been active on the international art circuit for the last 20 years. In 1991, she began her performance career with the reading of porno-erotic texts, focusing her critique on the repression of women. Boliver’s work is historically situated amongst the most radical of Mexican Body Art.

Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. Tomson Highway's keynote lecture explores the unique politics of Indigenous languages. For inside the verbs, pronouns, articles of the world’s Aboriginal languages are the keys to the planet’s long-term survival. Western languages hold that nature died at mankind’s eviction from a garden. Aboriginal languages refute this––to them, nature has a soul, the planet is a garden. Kill those languages and that vision––and the planet––would die.
[BIO] Tomson Highway is a writer from northern Manitoba, producing works in Cree, French, and English. His plays include The Rez Sisters, Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing, and Rose. He is the author of the best-selling novel Kiss of the Fur Queen. As a classically-trained pianist, he also frequently writes music for his shows.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): Opening address for the Hemispheric Institute's 9th Encuentro, held at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, sought to explore the multiple valences of the term MANIFEST! How are performances mobilized and syncretized in civic, community, and cultural contexts to create manifold forms of political expression? How do public, theatrical events produce ‘evidence’ that manifests ideas otherwise invisible, hidden, or unspeakable? What new manifestations, manifestos, festivals, and manifs emerge via our changing visions of political spaces, intellectual arenas, and the everyday street? The 2014 Encuentro invited artists, activists, and scholars to engage with and investigate the aesthetic, social, and choreographic techniques that transform political ideas into collective images, through actions, embodied utterances, and ways of being. Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history.

Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. In this keynote lecture, Frances Fox Piven explores how protest movements sometimes act as a driving force in the transformation of societies. She examines how movements succeed in penetrating the fog generated by dominant political discourse, and how they sometimes wield sufficient power or leverage by disrupting institutionalized relationships.
[BIO] Frances Fox Piven is on the faculty of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. She writes about social movements, and her books include Regulating the Poor (1972), Poor People’s Movements (1977), Why Americans Don’t Vote (1988) and Challenging Authority (2006).

Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. Homage is an act of gender queer corporeal agency. It is an offering of vulnerability. Homage opens wounds that have healed on Grey's body in order to reactivate the psychic energy stored there and to invite the audience to eradicate the boundaries between us.
[BIO] Kris Grey/Justin Credible is a New York City-based artist whose practice interrogates systems of power through the lens of gender. Their work exists at the intersection of communication, activism, community building, storytelling, lecture, and studio production in media that is two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and time-based.

Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. The analysis of indigenous social movements often focuses on their public manifestations and manifestos, revealing an aspect of the world that advances certain agendas. Exploring the choreographies of these movements, Claudia Briones's keynote introduces a distinction between contentious politics and prefigurative politics, and examines their archives and repertoires of struggle.
[BIO] Claudia Briones received her PhD in Anthropology from UT Austin. She is a Full Professor at Universidad de Buenos Aires and Universidad Nacional de Río Negro, and a Researcher at the National Council on Scientific and Technical Research at the Research Institute on Cultural Diversity and Processes of Change, in Argentina.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The Hemispheric Institute's 9th Encuentro, held at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, sought to explore the multiple valences of the term MANIFEST! How are performances mobilized and syncretized in civic, community, and cultural contexts to create manifold forms of political expression? How do public, theatrical events produce ‘evidence’ that manifests ideas otherwise invisible, hidden, or unspeakable? What new manifestations, manifestos, festivals, and manifs emerge via our changing visions of political spaces, intellectual arenas, and the everyday street? The 2014 Encuentro invited artists, activists, and scholars to engage with and investigate the aesthetic, social, and choreographic techniques that transform political ideas into collective images, through actions, embodied utterances, and ways of being. Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history.
[BIO] Jack Halberstam is Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California.

Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. Flagrantly fanciful and subversive, the protest ensemble Anonymous became widely popular among some Internet geeks, political activists, and academics along with many unmarked spectators. In this keynote lecture, Gabriella Coleman examines Anonymous' popular appeal through the vantage point of their art, artistry, and trickery.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SYNOPSIS] The Hemispheric Institute's 9th Encuentro, held at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, sought to explore the multiple valences of the term MANIFEST! How are performances mobilized and syncretized in civic, community, and cultural contexts to create manifold forms of political expression? How do public, theatrical events produce ‘evidence’ that manifests ideas otherwise invisible, hidden, or unspeakable? What new manifestations, manifestos, festivals, and manifs emerge via our changing visions of political spaces, intellectual arenas, and the everyday street? The 2014 Encuentro invited artists, activists, and scholars to engage with and investigate the aesthetic, social, and choreographic techniques that transform political ideas into collective images, through actions, embodied utterances, and ways of being. Such questions resonated in the host city of Montréal, where la manifestation has a rich and ongoing history. Peter Schumann's keynote lecture is a poetic-performatic-musical environmental manifesto and a meditation on puppetry: 'We and the caribou, dwarves of the giant corporate system that runs our life and devastation, are here to rise up. Columbus, who imports the New World Order, drums in the billionaire-superheroes who dominate our economy, which destroys the herds that roam the earth, and we all end up in the same boat, with no idea where we are going.'
[BIO] The Bread & Puppet Theater was founded in 1963 on New York City’s Lower East Side by Silesian-born sculptor and choreographer, Peter Schumann. Their shows address social, political and environmental issues or simply the common urgencies of our lives. They are one of the oldest, nonprofit, self-supporting theater companies in the United States.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Refusing to limit the expression of the artists it presents and funds, Franklin Furnace held 'Franklin Furnace Fights for First Amendment Rights' at The Public Theater as the culture wars began in the United States. This event was prompted by the recent closure of Franklin Furnace by the New York Fire Department for being an 'illegal social club,' despite the organization’s growing recognition as an avant-garde gallery. Following the closure, Franklin Furnace was demonized by Republican Senator Jesse Helms for presenting Karen Finley's installation, A Woman's Life Isn't Worth (1990), which led to audits by the Internal Revenue Service and later to rescinded grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.  In Franklin Furnace Fights for First Amendment Rights, artists and guests address the growing wave of censorship in the arts, especially surrounding sexual, queer, and feminist content, as well as the conservative political agendas projected onto the artistic landscape of the United States.  Featured presenters in this video include Spalding Gray, Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, Eric Bogosian, Cee Brown, Allen Ginsberg, Diane Torr, Paul McMahon, Nancy Spero, and Leon Golub.
[BIO] Franklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas. The organization has developed a place in art history for artists’ books, temporary installation art, and performance art. www.franklinfurnace.org

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): 
[SYNOPSIS] In Fountain Patty Chang stares into a mirror while drinking water from her reflection.  To create the visual imagery depicted in the frame, Chang placed a video camera on a 45-degree angle while filming the live performance in her studio. Positioning the camera at this angle changes the plane of the video and also reshapes how viewers see the footage of the performance. Viewers are not aware of this stylistic approach when watching the footage, but instead see a re-purposed view of the live performance that has been displayed vertically in the video. The approaches that Chang takes in Fountain are political in their form as well as content, addressing standards of beauty, representations of Asian women, and the problematics of the male gaze. Fountain was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s 'History of the Future' (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015. 
[BIO] Patty Chang’s performative works deal with themes of gender, language, and empathy.  Working predominantly in video, Chang uses the medium to document her performances, often utilizing the camera’s potential to misrepresent. Her works often challenge viewers’ perceptions of what they see, frequently creating visual sleights of hand that highlight fantastical representations of 'Asia.'  Chang’s work has been exhibited nationwide and internationally at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the New Museum in New York; the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the Hamburg Kunstverein in Hamburg, Germany; and the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. She was nominated for the Hugo Boss Prize in 2008, named the Guna S. Mundheim Fellow of Visual Arts at the American Academy in Berlin in 2009, and a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014.  www.pattychang.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] The Lion and the Jewel confronts gender and cultural norms in a small Nigerian village. The play opens with nature sounds in a village setting in Nigeria. A man and woman engage in a conversation surrounding the man’s displeasure for the women’s appearance. As the two discuss the possibility of a relationship together, the male character is contradicting: he degrades her as a woman, but promises her the greatest romance. The woman is pressured into marrying the man, Baroka, who takes on the presence of the Lion. The woman, Sidi, will not conform to the tribal norm of marrying, however, and refuses to be the jewel. The play follows Sidi's struggle with Baroka and her village. At the end of the play, Sidi remains strong and rejects Baroka's marriage proposal, refusing to accept her position as inferior to men.

[BIO]  From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a "new world"--one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic "outpost" in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community-organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Foghorn features a series of vignettes relating to the centuries of oppression and violence of American Indians in the United States. In one scene, a nun preaches Christianity and "civilization" to Native children, referencing the residential boarding schools that operated in the United States from the late-eighteenth to mid-nineteenth century. In another scene, a Native American and a cowboy speak about the long history of broken treaties with Native peoples. The piece ends by emphasizing and celebrating the value of Native identity, which survives even in the face of violence and persecution.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of 
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a 
vision of a "new world"--one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and 
was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 
"outpost" in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community-organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South 
Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations 
with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; 
artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, 
methods, and production.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Taking its name from the community of descendants of African slaves living on the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, Gullah! uses dialogue, song, and dance to tell the story of the everyday struggles faced by African Americans in the Southeastern Lowcountry. The characters discuss issues of education, class, and income disparity, as well as gender roles and politics, as they negotiate racism and hardship in the American South. Written by famed African-American playwright Alice Childress, Gullah! at once celebrates Southern Black culture and stresses the hardships that coincide with it.

[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of 
artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a 
vision of a "new world"--one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and 
was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics. From a geographic 
"outpost" in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community-organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South 
Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations 
with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; 
artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, 
methods, and production.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Combining live music with circus performance, Circus Amok presents a variety show of freaks, queers, and clowns who mix the circus language of juggling, humor, dance, and acrobats with political satire dealing with abortion, unemployment, homophobia, rape, capitalism, AIDS, and queer politics. This performance features people eating fire, choreographies, and gender benders, in a series of small acts, one after the other, including a depressed acrobat, a tight rope of failure, and the comically sarcastic monologues of Jennifer Miller, the bearded woman and leader of Circus Amok.

[BIO] Circus Amok is a New York City-based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989, bringing its funny, queer, caustic, and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills--tight-rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, and clowning--have been combined with experimental dance, life-sized puppetry, music old and new, gender-bending performance art, and improvisational techniques, to create new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds. Circus Amok invites the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a celebratory, queer spectacle.

[SYNOPSIS] MOO is a 2009 outdoor circus performance with a live band at Tompkins Square Park in New York City's East Village.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Ron Athey’s Four Scenes in a Harsh Life (1994) confronts the sexual politics of religiosity. Expressed through ritualistic acts, Athey  and his fellow performers, Divinity P. Fudge, Julie Tolentino, and Pig Pen, use the body as a site to queer religious iconography and to reconstitute a politic that affirms the queer body amid the AIDS crisis and culture wars in the United States. Heightened by national homophobia and conservative agendas, Athey, who is HIV-positive, was falsely accused by the Minneapolis Star and other media outlets for exposing the audience to AIDS-tainted blood, when in fact the blood central to the performance was from performer Divinity P. Fudge, who is HIV-negative. The polemic of blood in the performance ignited discrimination and censorship of Athey’s work across art venues and by the National Endowment for the Arts. Athey was also attacked by the religious right for employing a queer lens to examine religion, gender, and sexuality. Through the performance, Athey and company manifest a stigmata of the queer body that sparked national debates on censoring and exhibiting sexually explicit art.  Following the mass censorship of Athey’s work in the the art world, video documentation of Four Scenes in a Harsh Life was broadcast online as part of Franklin Furnace’s “History of the Future” (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com).

[BIO] Ron Athey is a London-based performance artist from Los Angeles. He has performed body and sound-based works since 1981, debuting with Premature Ejaculation (PE), a collaboration with Rozz Williams. In the height of the AIDS pandemic, Ron Athey and Company toured “The Torture Trilogy” (1992-1995) at art venues across the world. Athey began his solo career with “Solar Anus” (1998) and later with “Self Obliteration” (2007-2012), while simultaneously developing “Incorruptible Flesh” (1997-2008). He has collaborated with Lawrence Steger on “Incorruptible Flesh (In Progress)” (1996), Juliana Snapper on “The Judas Cradle” (2004), and Julie Tolentino on company works throughout the 90s and “The Sky Remains the Same” (2008-). A monograph of Athey’s work, Pleading in the Blood, edited by Dominic Johnson, was published by Intellect Ltd. in 2013. www.ronathey.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] In the midst of the US culture wars, Franklin Furnace, in collaboration with the Brooklyn Museum, presented “Too Shocking To Show.” The event was prompted by the National Endowment for the Arts’ revocation of Franklin Furnace’s Visual Artists Organizations grant and the heightened institutional censorship of sexually explicit art. Throughout the performance, speakers discuss the systemic effects of censorship by the NEA, alongside artists that have either been censored by the NEA or considered obscene by conservative and religious groups. It examines how the NEA impacts the inclusion of sexual imagery and political subject matter in the arts. Featured speakers and artists in this video include Robert T. Buck, Martha Wilson, Carol S. Vance, Sapphire, Holly Hughes, Scarlet O, and Tim Miller.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Tim Miller’s Stretch Marks (1990) is a call to action regarding sexual politics in the height of the AIDS epidemic. Miller employs a queer temporality by relaying his coming-out in high school to his present identity as a gay man, artist, and citizen. He addresses the political climate of HIV/AIDS in the United States and how the disease has led to homophobic agendas, specifically under Ronald Reagan’s administration. Miller assumes a voice of political agency through his involvement with ACT UP Los Angeles and critiques the medical industrial complex for contributing to the AIDS death toll. He concludes by envisioning a queer futurity beyond the stigma of HIV/AIDS where gay men are free to be themselves. Stretch Marks was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s “History of the Future” (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars, however, leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full by HIDVL in 2015. 

[BIO] Tim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's work explores the artistic, spiritual, and political topography of his identity as a gay man. His performances have been presented across the world in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, London Institute of Contemporary Art, Walker Art Center, Actors Theatre of Louisville, and Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miller is the author of Shirts & Skin (1997), Body Blows (2002), and 1001 Beds (2006), and his solo performance works have been published in O Solo Homo (1998) and Sharing the Delirium (1994). He has taught performance at the University of California, Los Angeles, New York University, the School of Theology at Claremont University, and other universities across the United States. He is a co-founder of Performance Space 122 in New York City and Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, California. www.timmillerperformer.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] In Imagine Being More Afraid of Freedom Than Slavery (1995), Pamela Sneed navigates the legacy of slavery and how it informs her identity as a black woman. Sneed references Audre Lorde, Assata Shakur, and Harriet Tubman as a political gesture to recover the historical erasure of these black women figures. In doing so, she retraces a part of her lost identity as a black woman and lesbian, while also forming a body politic around race, gender, and sexuality. Expanding upon the lineage of these black women figures, Sneed navigates the tensions between freedom and slavery in a post-civil rights era, noting the psychological impact of colonial, patriarchal, and capitalist structures. Sneed’s journey is personal and political in the quest to recover a lost identity and move towards a state of personal liberation.

[BIO] Pamela Sneed is a New York City-based poet and actress. Her work explores the personal as political, while commenting on race, pop culture, history, feminism, and more. She is the author of Imagine Being More Afraid of Freedom Than Slavery (1998) published by Henry Holt; KONG (2009), along with other works published by Vintage Entity Press; and the chapbook, Lincoln (2014). Sneed has performed original works for sold out houses at Lincoln Center, PS 122, BAM Cafe, Central Park SummerStage in New York, New York; Ex-Teresa in DF, Mexico; The ICA in London, England; The CCA in Glasgow, Scotland; and The Green Room in Manchester, England. She has been featured in New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Time Out, Bomb, VIBE, and on the cover of New York Magazine. Sneed is part-time theater faculty at Sarah Lawrence College in New York.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Johanna Went creates a theater of the grotesque in Twin, Travel, Terror (1987). Went, along with assistants Anne Iobst and Lucy Sexton of Dancenoise, performs a series of actions depicting social anarchy, feminist motifs, and political upheaval. In avant-garde style, the all-female cast deconstructs, assembles, and recycles taboo subjects and found materials. Went expels unscripted grunts and phrases against a punk soundtrack composed by Mark Wheaton, while Iobst and Sexton improvise movements with homemade props and costumes. The combined elements of the performance conjure a monstrous effect resulting in a grotesque theatrical experience.

[BIO] Johanna Went is a Los Angeles-based artist whose synthesis of avant-garde punk and performance art has made her an underground success. Went, known as the “Hyena of Performance Art,” is recognized for assembling found objects and homemade props/costumes that her transgressive characters animate on stage. She is also renowned for her use of improvised vocals and soundscapes that draw upon punk, electronic, and industrial music. Selected works by Went include Hyena (1982); Having Fun in the Dark (1983); Knifeboxing (1984); Interview with Monkey Woman (1986); Primate Prisoners (1987); Twin, Travel, Terror (1987); and Ablutions of a Nefarious Nature (2007). Soleilmoon Recordings released Johanna Went: Club Years (2007), a DVD/CD compilation featuring video documentation of Went’s performances in clubs and galleries throughout Los Angeles, live studio recordings with collaborator Mark Wheaton, and the complete HyeNa LP along with other musical works.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Franklin Furnace's Matthew Hogan curates a selection of poetic works as part of "Concrete Poetry" (1988). This exhibition, held at Franklin Furnace, featured an array of books, audio, and videotapes of concrete poetry—a form of poetry depicted through semantic, visual, and phonetic elements of language. It drew from Franklin Furnace's artists' books collection, the nation's largest repository of the avant-garde book form, and also included a selection of materials on loan from anonymous donors. The works featured in "Concrete Poetry" (1988) expand upon the motifs of pop-up poems, constellation poems, and typopoems explored in "Concrete Poetry: The Early Years" (1986), an exhibition organized by Franklin Furnace and presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This video includes poetic works by Augusto de Campos, Emmett Williams, Paul de Vree, Jiri Kolar, and Wolfgang Schmidt.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]Susan Leigh Foster's ""Choreographies of Writing"" (2011) is an embodied exploration of dance and of writing as choreographic practices. In this performative lecture, Foster teases out the tension—historical and contemporary—between writing about dance, and dance itself. She points to performative writing as an emerging genre articulating and complicating the relationship between the two disciplines. Performative writing seeks to mirror or gesture toward the dancing subject instead of commenting upon dance from a disembodied, objectifying stance. Citing theorists and practitioners such as Emma Hammergren, Marta Savigliano, and Randy Martin, Foster dances along with and against the writing, deepening the textuality of the piece and further underscoring her central thesis: the choreography of dance and of writing are each corporeal, theoretical, and cultural. Here, Foster affirms that the praxis of choreography offers the makers of both art forms a means of communicating through signifiers that disrupt the traditional division, instead creating a duet of embodied, socio-cultural transformation.
The lecture is followed by a Question and Answer discussion.
[BIO]Susan Leigh Foster, choreographer and scholar, is Distinguished Professor in the Department of World Arts and Cultures/Dance at UCLA. She is the author of Reading Dancing: Bodies and Subjects in Contemporary American Dance, Choreography and Narrative: Ballet’s Staging of Story and Desire, Dances that Describe Themselves: The Improvised Choreography of Richard Bull, and Choreographing Empathy: Kinesthesia in Performance.  She is also the editor of three anthologies: Choreographing History, Corporealities, and Worlding Dance.

Here, Foster affirms that the praxis of choreography offers the makers of both art forms a means of communicating through signifiers that disrupt the traditional division, instead creating a duet of embodied, socio-cultural transformation.

The lecture is followed by a Question and Answer discussion.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]In the performative lecture "Kinesthetic Empathies & the Politics of Compassion" (2011), Susan Leigh Foster poses questions of witnessing, empathizing, and knowing as corporeal potentialities. From the outer limits of the possible Foster introduces various theories on empathy—in one example from Monsieur Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt, she explores the viewer's ability to relate to the tightrope walker, whose precarious balancing act leaves both viewer and dancer in suspense, the viewer feeling as though they too might fall. In another instance she draws from philosophers Adam Smith and, later, John Martin to illustrate the impossibility of truly feeling what another experiences, although dance's ability to ignite ""inner mimicry"" creates a resonance between the dancing and the viewing bodies. All the while Foster dances, gestures, and emphasizes those moments of semiosis between dancer and viewer, simultaneously rejecting the problematics of a dance politic favoring sameness over difference and one favoring difference to the exclusion of commonalities. She points to sociocultural factors informing each kinesthetic framework and to historic and contemporary efforts to justify the "workings of power" through empathetic responses that actually limit the means of true societal transformation. Toward the end of the lecture Foster invites volunteers to mirror one another in pursuit of differences and parallels. As the volunteers dance Foster champions the empathetic frameworks as tools for sensing "how power moves, when it consolidates, and where it disperses." 
The lecture is followed by a Question and Answer discussion.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]Susan Leigh Foster's ""The Ballerina's Phallic Pointe"" is a performative lecture exploring the sexual and gender constructs within balletic dance. Countering Romantic era ideas of the ballerina as the hyperfeminine subject, Foster reorients conventional understandings toward the ballerina as the vehicle for performing masculine desire. The ballerina is the central focus throughout the performance—an erect, dancing body donning flesh-toned hues that is always guided, lifted, and positioned by the male dancer who is secondary in focus but who is effectively in control. She is, Foster argues, a phallus. As the physical and symbolic representation of male desire and power, the ballerina originates from masculine notions of femininity, most often appearing in classic ballet as either the ethereal and virginal dancer or the exotic, mysterious ""other"" who, in either instance, the plot often disappears or kills after she fulfills her function. Foster links the sexualized ballerina to several tenets upholding patriarchy, among them the balletic body as an object of sexualized fantasy and as a ""fetishized promise of sexual acquisition."" Underscoring Foster's argument are her own balletic movements: she balances on one leg, extending the other on the table and performing various gestures before unzipping her pants to unfurl the limp, pink ballet tights at the moment she announces the ballerina as phallus. She situates small ballerina figurines on the table, removing them from a 1950s-era pink ballet bag, continuing to balance on one leg, before eventually rolling up her pants leg to shave the other leg with a razor and shaving cream. Every object is pink. Foster's movements are linked theoretically and temporally to her concluding argument that, although ballet has seen great transformation since the Romantic era, contemporary balletic dance nonetheless employs a phallic ballerina who enacts masculine desire through her legs and, by extension, her pointe shoes. While not absent from the male gaze, Foster points to the increasing number of solo dances and female-led choreographies, among other feminist advances within ballet, as opportunities for subsuming the phallus into the woman, creating a ""monstrous"" subject defying categorization or limitation.
The lecture is followed by a Question & Answer discussion.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Part of Carlos Motta's GENDER TALENTS project, this interview features Valentina Riascos, a trans woman and human rights activist working with Santamaría Fundación, an organization in Cali, Colombia, whose mission is "to promote the self-determination of trans individuals in the participation, promotion, advocacy, assurance, and monitoring of human rights to influence public policy and the state."

GENDER TALENTS is a web-based project by artist Carlos Motta that engages movements and discourses for gender self-determination within trans and intersex communities internationally. GENDER TALENTS features an online archive of video portraits of trans and intersex activists who thoughtfully perform gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action. 

[BIO] Carlos Motta is a multi-disciplinary artist whose work draws upon political history in an attempt to create counter narratives that recognize suppressed histories, communities, and identities. Motta’s work has been presented internationally in venues such as Tate Modern, London; The New Museum, The Guggenheim Museum and MoMA/PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; Museo de Arte del Banco de la República, Bogotá; Museu Serralves, Porto; Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona; National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens; Castello di Rivoli, Turin; CCS Bard Hessel Museum of Art, Annandale-on-Hudson; San Francisco Art Institute; Hebbel am Ufer, Berlin; Witte de With, Rotterdam; Sala de Arte Público Siqueiros, Mexico City; and many other public, private and independent spaces throughout the world. Motta won the Main Prize—Future Generation Art Prize of the PinchukArtCentre in Kiev (2014). He delivered talks and presentations at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Jeu de Paume, Paris in October 2014. He also delivered a keynote presentation during SF MoMA’s Visual Activism symposium in San Francisco in March 2014. Together with AA Bronson, Motta convened in November 2013 the event ritual of queer rituals at Witte de With in Rotterdam. Motta guest edited the e-flux journal April 2013 issue, “(im)practical (im)possibilities” on contemporary queer art and culture. Motta is a graduate of the Whitney Independent Study Program (2006), was named a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (2008), and received grants from Art Matters (2008), NYSCA (2010), Creative Capital Foundation and the Kindle Project (2012). He is part of the faculty at Parsons The New School of Design and The School of Visual Arts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Part of Carlos Motta's GENDER TALENTS project, this video features human rights activist Alondra Yajaira Marquez as she accompanies Tania Marcela Camelo to file a police harassment complaint at a police station in Cali.

GENDER TALENTS is a web-based project by artist Carlos Motta that engages 
movements and discourses for gender self-determination within trans and 
intersex communities internationally. GENDER TALENTS features an online archive 
of video portraits of trans and intersex activists who thoughtfully perform 
gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social 
condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, 
India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists 
challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender 
norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and 
disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates 
bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action.

[BIO] Carlos Motta is a multi-disciplinary artist whose work draws upon 
political history in an attempt to create counter narratives that recognize 
suppressed histories, communities, and identities. Motta’s work has been 
presented internationally in venues such as Tate Modern, London; The New 
Museum, The Guggenheim Museum and MoMA/PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; 
Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; Museo de Arte del Banco de la 
República, Bogotá; Museu Serralves, Porto; Museu d’Art Contemporani de 
Barcelona; National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens; Castello di Rivoli, 
Turin; CCS Bard Hessel Museum of Art, Annandale-on-Hudson; San Francisco Art 
Institute; Hebbel am Ufer, Berlin; Witte de With, Rotterdam; Sala de Arte 
Público Siqueiros, Mexico City; and many other public, private and independent 
spaces throughout the world. Motta won the Main Prize—Future Generation Art 
Prize of the PinchukArtCentre in Kiev (2014). He delivered talks and 
presentations at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Jeu de Paume, 
Paris in October 2014. He also delivered a keynote presentation during SF

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Part of Carlos Motta's GENDER TALENTS project, in this interview Pedro Julio Pardo, co-founder of Santamaría Fundación, tells about Déborah Skenassy, her other persona. Santamaría Fundación is an organization in Cali, Colombia, whose mission is "to promote the self-determination of trans individuals in the participation, promotion, advocacy, assurance, and monitoring of human rights to influence public policy and the state."

GENDER TALENTS is a web-based project by artist Carlos Motta that engages 
movements and discourses for gender self-determination within trans and 
intersex communities internationally. GENDER TALENTS features an online archive 
of video portraits of trans and intersex activists who thoughtfully perform 
gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social 
condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, 
India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists 
challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender 
norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and 
disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates 
bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action. 


[BIO] Carlos Motta is a multi-disciplinary artist whose work draws upon 
political history in an attempt to create counter narratives that recognize 
suppressed histories, communities, and identities. Motta’s work has been 
presented internationally in venues such as Tate Modern, London; The New 
Museum, The Guggenheim Museum and MoMA/PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; Museo de Arte del Banco de la 
República, Bogotá; Museu Serralves, Porto; Museu d’Art Contemporani de

movements and discourses for gender self-determination within trans and 
intersex communities internationally. GENDER TALENTS features an online archive 
of video portraits of trans and intersex activists who thoughtfully perform 
gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social 
condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, 
India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists 
challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender 
norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and 
disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates 
bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
Part of Carlos Motta's GENDER TALENTS project, this interview features Daniela Lux, a trans woman living in Guatemala City, where she owns a restaurant. She is a beneficiary of REDMMUTRANS. RED MULTICULTURAL DE MUJERES TRANS DE GUATEMALA (REDMMUTRANS) was founded in Guatemala in 2011 to support trans women of different cultural backgrounds as they confront a social, cultural, and political context where they face discrimination for their gender identities and expressions, their ethnic and racial backgrounds, and their activities as sex workers.

GENDER TALENTS is a web-based project by artist Carlos Motta that engages 
movements and discourses for gender self-determination within trans and 
intersex communities internationally. GENDER TALENTS features an online archive 
of video portraits of trans and intersex activists who thoughtfully perform 
gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social 
condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, 
India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists 
challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender 
norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and 
disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates 
bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action.

gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social 
condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, 
India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists 
challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender 
norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and 
disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates 
bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Part of Carlos Motta's GENDER TALENTS project, this interview 
features David Iris Cameron, an intersex activist living in San Francisco.

GENDER TALENTS is a web-based project by artist Carlos Motta that engages 
movements and discourses for gender self-determination within trans and 
intersex communities internationally. GENDER TALENTS features an online archive 
of video portraits of trans and intersex activists who thoughtfully perform 
gender as a personal, social, and political opportunity rather than as a social 
condemnation. Based on in-depth interviews conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, 
India, and the United States, the portraits expose the ways that activists 
challenge the bio-cultural “foundations” of society and question gender 
norms from the perspective of sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and 
disability. It documents the ways in which society conditions and regulates 
bodies and how gender activists build politics of resistance and action. 

[BIO] Carlos Motta is a multi-disciplinary artist whose work draws upon 
political history in an attempt to create counter narratives that recognize 
suppressed histories, communities, and identities. Motta’s work has been 
presented internationally in venues such as Tate Modern, London; The New 
Museum, The Guggenheim Museum and MoMA/PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; Museo de Arte del Banco de la 
República, Bogotá; Museu Serralves, Porto; Museu d’Art Contemporani de 
Barcelona; National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens; Castello di Rivoli, 
Turin; CCS Bard Hessel Museum of Art, Annandale-on-Hudson; San Francisco Art 
Institute; Hebbel am Ufer, Berlin; Witte de With, Rotterdam; Sala de Arte 
Público Siqueiros, Mexico City; and many other public, private and independent 
spaces throughout the world. Motta won the Main Prize—Future Generation Art 
Prize of the PinchukArtCentre in Kiev (2014). He delivered talks and 
presentations at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Jeu de Paume, 
Paris in October 2014. He also delivered a keynote presentation during SF 
MoMA’s Visual Activism symposium in San Francisco in March 2014. Together 
with AA Bronson, Motta convened in November 2013 the event ritual of queer 
rituals at Witte de With in Rotterdam. Motta guest edited the e-flux journal 
April 2013 issue, “(im)practical (im)possibilities” on contemporary queer 
art and culture. Motta is a graduate of the Whitney Independent Study Program 
(2006), was named a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (2008), and received grants

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] The second of two full-length shows conceived, written, and performed by Pomo Afro Homos (Postmodern African-American Homosexuals), Dark Fruit premiered at the Public Theatre in December 1991 and went on to tour the US and England. Its searing critique of family and identity within African-American and mainstream cultures were emblematic of the group's work. Starting out with a satirical medical analysis of the black homosexual male, Dark Fruit weaves together a variety of sketches, excerpts from Pomo Afro Homos' previous performances, and original vignettes covering the complexities of black gay life. By engaging a range of topics, including school integration, interracial relationships, and generational conceptions of queerness, the members of Pomo Afro Homos each created a collaborative, broad-ranging vision of what it means to be a human living in a particular kind of body.

[BIO] Djola Branner is an interdisciplinary artist/educator who combines movement, sound, and light to create compelling portraits of American life for the stage. His original full-length and one-act dramas give voice to individuals historically absent from the theater and explore a broad range of human experiences.

Co-founder of the award-winning performance group Pomo Afro Homos, Branner toured nationally and internationally with their shows Fierce Love: Stories from Black Gay Life and Dark Fruit. Both productions, scripted and performed by the Pomos, addressed the historical absence of three-dimensional black, gay characters in the theater and have proved seminal to the contemporary interrogation of African-American male identity. Branner’s interdisciplinary work has been supported by Creative Capital, the Jerome, McKnight, and Bush Foundations, and published in such anthologies as Black Gay Genius, Colored Contradictions, Staging Gay Lives, and Voices Rising: Celebrating 20 Years of Lesbian and Gay Black Writers.

Branner’s professional life has been defined by a passion for scripting, staging, and performing original drama, and that passion has defined his approach to teaching, as well. His classrooms/studios are marked by a commitment to unearthing each student-artist’s authentic voice through an integration of theatrical disciplines and a challenge to examine the cultural context of their work. He has taught dance, acting, and dramatic writing for more than thirty years in community and academic settings, including City College of San Francisco, Stanford University, University of Minnesota, Macalester College, and American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

He is a graduate of San Francisco State University, where he earned an MA in Creative Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies, and The New School for Drama, where he earned an MFA in Theatre. Branner is currently Professor of Theater at Hampshire College. He is a member of the Dramatists’ Guild.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] This performance of Dark Fruit represents the second iteration of the show. Marvin K. White stepped in for Eric Gupton during the latter's sabbatical.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Fierce Love was conceived, written, and performed as a response to the absence of three-dimensional black, gay men on the American stage. The show premiered at Josie's Juice Joint & Cabaret in San Francisco in January 1991, and went on to tour nationally and internationally to critical acclaim until 1994. (Brian Freeman revived the show with a new cast in 2010.) This recording marks the final performance by the original ensemble cast of the Pomos--Djola Branner, Brian Freeman, and Eric Gupton--and includes a post-show discussion.

[BIO] Djola Branner is an interdisciplinary artist/educator who combines movement, sound, and light to create compelling portraits of American life for the stage. His original full-length and one-act dramas give voice to individuals historically absent from the theater and explore a broad range of human experiences.

Co-founder of the award-winning performance group Pomo Afro Homos, Branner toured nationally and internationally with their shows Fierce Love: Stories from Black Gay Life and Dark Fruit. Both productions, scripted and performed by the Pomos, addressed the historical absence of three-dimensional black, gay characters in the theater and have proved seminal to the contemporary interrogation of African-American male identity. Branner’s interdisciplinary work has been supported by Creative Capital, the Jerome, McKnight, and Bush Foundations, and published in such anthologies as Black Gay Genius, Colored Contradictions, Staging Gay Lives, and Voices Rising: Celebrating 20 Years of Lesbian and Gay Black Writers.

Branner’s professional life has been defined by a passion for scripting, staging, and performing original drama, and that passion has defined his approach to teaching, as well. His classrooms/studios are marked by a commitment to unearthing each student-artist’s authentic voice through an integration of theatrical disciplines and a challenge to examine the cultural context of their work. He has taught dance, acting, and dramatic writing for more than thirty years in community and academic settings, including City College of San Francisco, Stanford University, University of Minnesota, Macalester College, and American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

He is a graduate of San Francisco State University, where he earned an MA in Creative Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies, and The New School for Drama, where he earned an MFA in Theatre. Branner is currently Professor of Theater at Hampshire College. He is a member of the Dramatists’ Guild.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] As co-director of the performance troupe Flesh & Spirit, Djola Branner choreographed and performed traditional Haitian and modern dances throughout the San Francisco Bay area from 1989 to 1994. The dances performed in this piece are taken from a secular celebration that occurs in Haiti before religious (vodou) ceremonies in the spring. Rara, as it is known in Haiti, is a festival of music and dancing during the Holy Week that precedes Easter.

[SYNOPSIS] This workshop performance (rap/song/dance) became the overture for Djola Banner's first full-length play, Homos in the House, which premiered at Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis in 1998. The play served up a searing response to black homophobia in the 1990s, particularly as it pertained to the spread and prevention of HIV and AIDS in the African-American community during the worst of the pandemic.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Funny Valentines is one of the few linear plays that Djola Branner has written and performed. The short play is an ode to the perils of speed dating. 'Nuff said.

[BIO] Djola Branner is an interdisciplinary artist/educator who combines movement, sound, and light to create compelling portraits of American life for the stage. His original full-length and one-act dramas give voice to individuals historically absent from the theater and explore a broad range of human experiences.

Co-founder of the award-winning performance group Pomo Afro Homos, Branner toured nationally and internationally with their shows Fierce Love: Stories from Black Gay Life and Dark Fruit. Both productions, scripted and performed by the Pomos, addressed the historical absence of three-dimensional black, gay characters in the theater and have proved seminal to the contemporary interrogation of African-American male identity. Branner’s interdisciplinary work has been supported by Creative Capital, the Jerome, McKnight, and Bush Foundations, and published in such anthologies as Black Gay Genius, Colored Contradictions, Staging Gay Lives, and Voices Rising: Celebrating 20 Years of Lesbian and Gay Black Writers.

Branner’s professional life has been defined by a passion for scripting, staging, and performing original drama, and that passion has defined his approach to teaching, as well. His classrooms/studios are marked by a commitment to unearthing each student-artist’s authentic voice through an integration of theatrical disciplines and a challenge to examine the cultural context of their work. He has taught dance, acting, and dramatic writing for more than thirty years in community and academic settings, including City College of San Francisco, Stanford University, University of Minnesota, Macalester College, and American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

He is a graduate of San Francisco State University, where he earned an MA in Creative Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies, and The New School for Drama, where he earned an MFA in Theatre. Branner is currently Professor of Theater at Hampshire College. He is a member of the Dramatists’ Guild.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] This video recording documents some of Djola's earliest work as a performer.  These four poems, based on classic blues and jazz forms, chronicle the content and character of Djola's life in San Francisco during the early eighties.

[BIO] Djola Branner is an interdisciplinary artist/educator who combines movement, sound, and light to create compelling portraits of American life for the stage. His original full-length and one-act dramas give voice to individuals historically absent from the theater and explore a broad range of human experiences.

Co-founder of the award-winning performance group Pomo Afro Homos, Branner toured nationally and internationally with their shows Fierce Love: Stories from Black Gay Life and Dark Fruit. Both productions, scripted and performed by the Pomos, addressed the historical absence of three-dimensional black, gay characters in the theater and have proved seminal to the contemporary interrogation of African-American male identity. Branner’s interdisciplinary work has been supported by Creative Capital, the Jerome, McKnight, and Bush Foundations, and published in such anthologies as Black Gay Genius, Colored Contradictions, Staging Gay Lives, and Voices Rising: Celebrating 20 Years of Lesbian and Gay Black Writers.

Branner’s professional life has been defined by a passion for scripting, staging, and performing original drama, and that passion has defined his approach to teaching, as well. His classrooms/studios are marked by a commitment to unearthing each student-artist’s authentic voice through an integration of theatrical disciplines and a challenge to examine the cultural context of their work. He has taught dance, acting, and dramatic writing for more than thirty years in community and academic settings, including City College of San Francisco, Stanford University, University of Minnesota, Macalester College, and American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] 'Sweet Sadie' is the only solo-show (thus far) conceived, written and performed by Djola Branner.  It premiered at Patrick's Cabaret in Minneapolis in 1994, and subsequently toured to Winston-Salem, San Francisco, Boston, New York, Anchorage and Leicester, England.  'Sweet Sadie' is inspired by autobiography, and dramatizes Branner's tumultuous maternal relationship with his mother. By physically embodying his mother in the first part of the performance, Branner performs his perceptions of his mother's trials and tribulations, feelings, and reactions to various life events that led up to Branner's birth and growth into a young man, exploring cultural and colloquial ideas of parenting as a single, divorced black mother. Later, he switches into his own persona to speak about how he felt as a young, gay, black man raised by a woman like his mother, demonstrating his effort to empathize with his mother. The second half of the performance focuses on Branner coping with the slow loss of his mother through Alzheimer's, and her subsequent death. Ultimately unable to reconnect with her, he found solace in reaching out to her spirit through song and reminiscence. 'Sweet Sadie' stands as Branner's love letter and testament to his mother, exploring the rocky yet tender relationship between the two and how, without her presence in his life, Branner would not be where he is today, in his life or in his art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] This performance marked a turning point in Djola Branner's work. It blurred the boundaries between singers, dancers, and actors, abstracted traditional Haitian and modern dance idiom, African-American narrative and gospel lyrics, and aligned passion and spiritual epiphanty.  And it was just plain fun!

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Inspired by the children's book of the same title, this interdisciplinary collage of music, theatre, and dance provided a training ground for Djola Branner as a theatre maker. It also marked the first collaboration with Aaron Barnell, composer and musical director. The slide illustrations by Jan Thompson Dicks were used as set design. The deliberately irreverent tone of the house that crack built, created through the Narrator's comedic comments and frequent fourth wall breaking by directly involving the audience's opinions on the performances, allows for the more serious content of each skit to be more digestIble and humorous. The theatrical performance illustrates a sampling of the various ways that crack cocaine has affected the black community through vignettes into the lives of different black characters, with Djola Branner playing the poet and lead male figure in many of these segments.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] The Politisches Theatre lecture Boal gave in 1994 in Vienna, Austria, narrates the trajectory of the Theater of the Oppressed and several key moments in its trajectory.
Beginning with the socio-political history of Brazil in the 1960s, Boal marks the military dictatorship, discriminatory land laws, police abuse, drug trade in the slums, and migration as inspiring him to develop this method of theater. One of the early works called ‘The Peasants’ Story’ was an important turning point for the Theater of the Oppressed, because it taught Boal and his fellow actors not to create plays that demanded actions and risks they themselves were not ready to take, ‘I will never again going to do plays to insight people to do things I am not ready to do.’ From here, with Forum Theater Boal began to encourage others to join to express themselves and create theater works, such as ‘The Naked People Scene.’ In this way, people understood their problems to be political and them as active participants in opposing their oppression.

[BIO] Augusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical 
director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the 
most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author 
of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of 
Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for 
Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, 
a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education 
movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. 
Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims 
at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order 
to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that 
engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he 
who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to 
the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an 
instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all 
forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] This performance begins with Boal retelling when was elected to office in Rio de Janeiro, he began the legislative theater to organize groups of people to help them to fight oppression through theater.  Having marginalized people participate in the theater and express their problems, Boal brought attention to these issues through his political position and projects of law. The efforts of the Theater of the Oppressed to make substantial political change and extend the potential of democracy, led to the passing of 13 laws in Rio. In this performance, Boal recreates the years of Legislative Theater by breaking the participants into groups and giving them a socio-political issue to improvise and act on, such as minimum wage. As the 5 plays happen simultaneously, Boal offers ‘We present the problem, but the solution comes from you,’ to re-enforce that the political power comes from the people as they express their frustrations, create and propose legislation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Las Horas de Belén. A Book of Hours (1999), an across-the-border collaborative performance piece, focuses on the violence against women in colonial Mexico, especially the incarceration of women in Belen, a charitable ‘home’/prison founded in 1683 for unwed mothers and other socially marginalized women. The collaboration took shape over a period of two years. The collaborators include Ruth Malechech, director of New York-based Mabou Mines, Jesusa Rodríguez, Mexican director, actor, writer, and feminist activist, and her partner, Argentine-born singer-composer Liliana Felipe, visual artist Julie Archer, and poet Catherine Sasanov who, at the time, was writing poems inspired by the history of Mexico City and the circumstances of the founding of Belén. Sasanov´s poetry became the base of the script (consisting of song lyrics, projected writings, and minimal dialogue). Debuting in the 1999 Festival del Centro Histórico in March at the Claustro of Sor Juana in Mexico City, it then opened at P.S. 122 in New York City in May 1999 and has since played in various U.S. cities and returned to Mexico. While working on the piece, the women were deeply affected by reports of unsolved rapes and murders of hundreds of young women working in the maquila factories in U.S.-Mexico border towns. Official indifference to this violence echoed the stories the artists were uncovering about the women in Belén.

[BIO] Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist, Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her "espectáculos" (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and "carpa," to performative acts within political projects. She and her partner, Argentine singer/actor, own and operate El Habito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. They have won an Obie for Best Actor in Las Horas de Belén, A Book of Hours (1999) with Ruth Maleczech and New York-based Mabou Mines. Rodíguez contributes regularly to Mexico's most important feminist journal, debate feminista.

Liliana Felipe is one of Argentina's major composer and songwriter. With Jesusa Rodriguez, her partner for the last 30 years, she owned and ran El Hábito, one of Mexico's most important alternative performance spaces, and composed songs to most of Rodriguez's performances as she continued her own recording career.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] Monstrous Nature (2011) is a group piece that, in creator Marcela Levi's own words, "proposes bodies that are changed by their own fabulating strength." The stage floor is completely covered in fur, a grounding in the performance's animal-human dichotomy and the tension between embracing and engulfing. Three dancers appear as anthropomorphic figures, pivoting between animal and human gestures and sounds. They are three figures that pulsate, and this pulsation functions as motor to a gear that provokes accidents: it means, encounters, collisions, falls, affections.Their polyphonic utterances and contrasting movements explore abrupt shifts in tone—from frenetic to subdued, from docile to carnal—creating a blurring within and beyond the limits of the human. Monstrous Nature intersects micro-narratives and fictions reminiscent of mythology, building a surreal space for the audience to offer multiple interpretations of what takes place on stage. [BIO] In 2010, when they founded Improvável Produções - in Rio de Janeiro - Marcela Levi and Lucía Russo committed themselves to a shared-authorship project, a form of artistic direction based on the open concept of different inventive positions intertwining in a process that gathers together lines that deviate from one another: dissent and internal differences seen as constructive critical force rather than contradictory, self-exclusive polarities. 
Improvável Produções is responsible for creating and producing, among other projects, the performance “Monstrous Nature”, sponsored by the Rio de Janeiro City Department of Culture project Fostering Dance 2011; the urban intervention “Sandwalk with me”, developed between London and Rio de Janeiro with the support of the Rio de Janeiro State Department of Culture and the co-production of the Festival Panorama); and the project “Move over a little ”, co-produced with the Fundo Iberescena.
Trained at the Angel Vianna Dance School in Rio de Janeiro, Levi has been a resident artist at the Les Recollets Art Center in France; at the Casa Encendida and the Espaço Cultural Azala, both in Spain; at the ON.OFF Urban Creativity Laboratory held in Guimarães, Portugal (the European Cultural Capital, 2012); guest artist in the Rio Occupation London program at the London Cultural Olympiad promoted by SEC RJ; and recipient of the Batiscafo scholarship (Cuba). Her projects have been presented in various festivals and art centers in Brazil, Europe and Latin America.  Levi has worked in collaboration with Lia Rodrigues, Vera Mantero, Gustavo Ciríaco, Dani Lima, Cristina Moura and Guillermo Gomez-Peña, among others.
Lucía Russo studied Psychology at the University of Buenos Aires and contemporary dance at the European Dance Development Centre in Holland and the Rojas Cultural Center in Buenos Aires. Restless and always on the move, she circulates between artistic creation and the processes of transmitting, exchanging and managing cultural projects. She coordinated the project Dialogues: Interchanging processes of creation in contemporary dance (2006-2008) in Latin America, in partnership with the Red Sudamericana de Danza. Since 2010 she has developed the audience-focused project Future Spectators, articulating and creating bridges between theaters, artists and elementary and middle public schools in Rio de Janeiro. Russo has worked in collaboration with Diego Gil, Lucas Condró, Gustavo Ciríaco, Natalia Tencer and Ayara Hernández, among others.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SUMMARY]In Sandwalk With Me (2012) a group of people walk through Rio de Janeiro's financial district. They use special shoes that can carry sand inside and also use noise-canceling headphones. Here, the spectators are the participants. The audience is invited to remember and experience the beach that once existed in the now-financial district. This performance offers a commentary on humanity's encroachment on nature, as well as the loss of public spaces and their increasingly utilitarian function. Weighed down by sand shoes, Sandwalk With Me is an urban intervention requiring participants to decelerate, to contrast the overwhelming pace of the city and walk as they would on a beach—in step and in rhythm with nature.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] The evening of December 11, 2015, the Illuminator paid a visit to Le Pantheon in Paris to get the word out about the #D12 day of climate action in Paris. The following day, on December 12, the nonprofit organization 350 would launch a global day of action, #D12, to highlight the need for climate justice. 350.org works toward building a global, grassroots climate movement by creating online campaigns and mass public actions to hold world leaders accountable in actually addressing climate change. The group chose December 12 for its day of action because it was the last day of COP21 in Paris, the 21st annual convention of parties of the United Nations to address climate change. #D12 mobilized thousands of demonstrators to take the streets and march with signs, balloons, and red banners to call the attention of the UN leaders and emphasize how crucial it is to create sustainable, lasting climate justice. The Illuminator's projections encouraged passersby to "Swarm the System" and attend the #D12 day of action, raising their voices in solidarity with 350.org.

[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Initiated in March 2012, the project emerged out of the Occupy Wall Street movement in the wake of the original “OWS Bat Signal” projection-action of 17 November 2011. Since then the collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public spaces, both geographical and virtual, as acts of invitation and incitement. They transform the street from a space of passive consumption and transit into a site of engagement, conflict, and dialogue. Their interventions circulate across the internet as vivid talismans of trespass within the suffocating visual culture of commodity capitalism. In adopting a superhero persona, they strive to communicate in a pop-culture vernacular so that all may understand their mission: to smash the myths of the information industry and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. The Illuminator calls for heroism and for a broad-based popular movement to challenge entrenched power and initiate the radical social, political, and economic transformations that this critical moment demands.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In this piece, which responds to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip after the 2014 War in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas government of Palestine, The Illuminator projects an animation reading "End the Siege" onto the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in Manhattan. Since 1947, the Arabs of Palestine and the Jews of Israel have been fighting over the land now occupied by Israel. After the Arab-Israeli War of 1947-1948, the majority of the land was taken to form the state of Israel, while over one million Palestinian refugees were forcibly relocated to the relatively small territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  After the elections of 2006, the militant Hamas political party took power in Palestine, seizing total control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, in defiance of former peace agreements between Israel and Palestine from the early 1990s. Various failed attempts at a truce marked the next several years, but the violence steadily increased until 2014, when Israel launched a full military operation to stop rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. In June 2014, Israeli airstrikes commenced, followed by a ground invasion into Gaza in July, which lasted until a ceasefire was reached in August. Afterward, Israel reinstated its blockade of Gaza, preventing an influx of the resources necessary for the Palestinians to rebuild, and leaving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians homeless for many months.  The Illuminator projection refers to this blockade and calls on the Israelis to end the siege and allow the refugees to rebuild.

[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Initiated in March 2012, the project emerged out of the Occupy Wall Street movement in the wake of the original “OWS Bat Signal” projection-action of 17 November 2011. Since then the collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public spaces, both geographical and virtual, as acts of invitation and incitement. They transform the street from a space of passive consumption and transit into a site of engagement, conflict, and dialogue. Their interventions circulate across the internet as vivid talismans of trespass within the suffocating visual culture of commodity capitalism. In adopting a superhero persona, they strive to communicate in a pop-culture vernacular so that all may understand their mission: to smash the myths of the information industry and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. The Illuminator calls for heroism and for a broad-based popular movement to challenge entrenched power and initiate the radical social, political, and economic transformations that this critical moment demands.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] On August 16, 2012, the Illuminator traveled to the Russian Consulate in New York City and projected a graphic art intervention to "Free Pussy Riot," a Russian feminist punk rock protest group that had been imprisoned by the Russian government for their protests. Founded in 2011 in Moscow to advocate for feminism, LGBTQ rights, and opposition toward President Vladimir Putin, Pussy Riot staged public performances in Moscow, where they performed songs of rebellion and revolution, with lyrics that blatantly condemned the Russian government. After an infamous performance in Moscow's renowned Cathedral of the Savior, where the band performed before being stopped by church security (the video of the encounter was widely circulated online), three of the members were arrested in early March 2012 and charged with "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred." The Illuminator projected their insistence for the Russian government to free Pussy Riot the day before the three members of the group were indicted and incarcerated for their protests. This court ruling prompted international criticism, and Pussy Riot's case was championed by multiple human rights groups. On August 16, 2012, The Illuminator ventured throughout New York City, projecting Occupy Wall Street's "99%" logo on buildings they passed, along with the "Free Pussy Riot" slideshow onto the Russian Orthodox Church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York City.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In honor of Occupy Wall Street's one-year anniversary, The Illuminator goes around New York City to project messages of protest, revolution, and support for Occupy Wall Street. Occupy Wall Street started a year earlier, when a group of activists began occupying Zuccotti Park (formerly Liberty Park) in Lower Manhattan, capturing worldwide attention and launching a global campaign against social and economic inequality, corporate greed, and corruption. The Illuminator van, with its projector on top, projected these graphics upon the buildings of Manhattan--from housing projects to heavily trafficked bridges--while driving through traffic. Some of the projected messages also call out other protest movements and international crises, like the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, and the unlawful imprisonment of Russian feminist punk group Pussy Riot, illustrating OWS's solidarity with these other causes connected to their mission.

[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Initiated in March 2012, the project emerged out of the Occupy Wall Street movement in the wake of the original “OWS Bat Signal” projection-action of 17 November 2011. Since then the collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public spaces, both geographical and virtual, as acts of invitation and incitement.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] "Illuminating Protest" was developed by The Illuminator Collective from New York City for the Hemispheric Institute Encuentro of June 2014. The project involved embedding Illuminator member Grayson Earle within the Montreal student activist community for one month, in order to produce collaborative content for a series of interventions that took place during the Encuentro. Starting in 2012, the Montreal student activists were protesting the government's decision to increase college tuition by 80%. Heated encounters between law enforcement and the activists became more and more common as the demonstrations grew bolder and more controversial. Ultimately, the protests' focus grew to argue against the entire governmental structure, highlighting its overall failure to support its students and its citizens. To counteract the increasing size of these demonstrations, the Montreal city government passed a law known as P-6, which limits any protest without a permit to no more than fifty participants. When The Illuminator came to contribute to the demonstrations in 2014, they worked with Québécois students and activists to recreate moments of protest on a green screen, which were later projected back onto the city of Montreal as a creative circumvention of this law and in memoriam of the massive student strikes in Quebec of late 2011 and early 2012. The message "On Est Plus Que 50" emphasizes that, were it not for the P-6 Law, hundreds of protesters would continue to take to the streets, and that they continue to do so in spirit.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In conjunction with Art in Odd Places, a public art project started in 1996 that explores connections between pedestrian traffic, public space, and art interventions, The Illuminator shone their projection on student debt along 14th Street and 6th Avenue at the prestigious Parson's School of Design in Lower Manhattan. The projection asked passersby to text message responses to the question, “What does student debt mean to you?” In doing they, they asked participants to consider diverse ways that student debt affects their lives, in the hopes of starting a conversation to find solutions. The performance shone light on the crisis of student debt in the United States, where the average college student graduates with approximately $30,000 or more in debt. It also projected the harsh realities of living with student debt. Projections noted that the average salary for college graduates currently in the workforce is down 10% and that many college graduates feel as though they must "win the lottery" or "inherit a large trust fund" in order to live a financially independent and stable life.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] The Illuminator undertook a series of video projections over the week of September 15, 2015, to bring attention to the urgency of poverty, inequality and climate change through the global #LightTheWay campaign, a coalition of thousands of organizations worldwide dedicated to resolving these issues. In this teaser, The Illuminator projects onto the facade of the New Museum, a contemporary art museum in Lower Manhattan, to encourage people to join thousands of supporters at the #UnderOneSky rally at the United Nations on September 24. The rally is intended to support the September 25 announcement of new global UN Sustainable Development goals and to add pressure to carry through with them. The UN Sustainable Development project consists of 17 goals for UN member states to implement over the next 15 years, including the elimination of hunger worldwide and the promotion of affordable and clean energy. #LightTheWay aims to hold nations accountable for addressing and completing these goals, spreading awareness about them and collectively campaigning for them.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] The Morris Justice Project teamed up with The Illuminator the evening of September 20, 2011, at the corner of 161st Street and Park Avenue in New York City, to share some of the initial findings of their ongoing research into policing in the Morris Avenue area of the South Bronx. The Morris Justice Project began in 2011 as a communal effort between mothers living in the South Bronx, who were outraged by the New York Police Department's treatment of their sons and determined to catalogue and document their experiences with the police. This took the form of an ongoing research project in collaboration with the Public Science Project, John Jay College, and Pace University Law Center, guided by social knowledge of the area's disproportionate experience of discriminatory policing practices, and with the ultimate aim of creating a collective vision of community safety. In New York City, Black and Latino people are overwhelmingly targeted and surveilled by the police. As a crowd watched from across the street, The Illuminator projected onto a high-rise apartment building the results of a survey conducted with 1000 local residents of the area about police behavior and experiences. Two short films were also projected: Julie Dressner's New York Times op-doc "The Scars of Stop and Frisk," which follows a young black man in Brooklyn who had been stopped more than 60 times before age 18 by the police, and "Community Safety Act" by The New York Civil Liberties Union and Communities United for Police Reform, which details an effort to draft and pass legislation to end discriminatory policing in New York City, providing a community-based alternative. Both films address "stop and frisk," a common practice of the New York Police Department where police officers stop and question a pedestrian, and then search ("frisk") them for possible weapons and other contraband. The practice was deemed unconstitutional in 2013, yet still occurs in predominantly Black and Latino NYC neighborhoods. Drummers from BombaYo provided a musical intro.

[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Initiated in March 2012, the project emerged out of the Occupy Wall Street movement in the wake of the original “OWS Bat Signal” projection-action of 17 November 2011. Since then the collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public spaces, both geographical and virtual, as acts of invitation and incitement. They transform the street from a space of passive consumption and transit into a site of engagement, conflict, and dialogue. Their interventions circulate across the internet as vivid talismans of trespass within the suffocating visual culture of commodity capitalism. In adopting a superhero persona, they strive to communicate in a pop-culture vernacular so that all may understand their mission: to smash the myths of the information industry and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. The Illuminator calls for heroism and for a broad-based popular movement to challenge entrenched power and initiate the radical social, political, and economic transformations that this critical moment demands.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Two visual artists set up and activate their interactive projection, highlighting different interviewees' stories, at the 2015 O+ Festival in Kingston, NY. The non-profit, community-based O+ Festival provides a weekend-long platform for underinsured artists and musicians to create and perform in exchange for health and wellness services donated by local doctors, dentists, and complementary care providers. Its ultimate aim is to improve the physical and mental health of the participating artists and community members. The O+ Festival began when local upstate New York dentist Thomas F. Cingel, DDS, contacted an indie rock musician from a festival he attended, asking if he would play in his hometown of Kingston in exchange for free dental care. More wellness providers and artists were brought onboard, and O+ was born. The name "O+" comes from Kingston artist Denise Orzo, to reference the blood type of the universal donor, to emphasize the festival's goal to connect everyone through art and free healthcare.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] On November 17, 2011, at 6pm, Occupy Wall Street activists projected a large image of the movement's "Bat Signal" onto the side of the Verizon building at 375 Pearl Street, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. Occupy Wall Street began two months earlier, when a group of young activists occupied Zuccotti Park (formerly Liberty Park) in Lower Manhattan, capturing the world's attention and launching a global campaign against social and economic inequality, corporate greed, and corruption. They enacted a campground headquarters for their activities, and two days before the Bat Signal action, these activists were forcibly removed from the Park by the New York Police Department. The Bat Signal projection featured bold, colorful graphics of the activists' logo and mission. The projection begins with a circle reading "99%" to signify the movement's declaration that they are the 99% of people denied the financial and economic power that the Wall Street elite and uber-rich possess. Next, projections of declarations like "Mic check," "Another world is possible," and "We are winning" act as visual calls-to-action and words of encouragement for the crowds of OWS demonstrators as they march along the FDR highway on Manhattan's east side.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] This video documents the launch of The Illuminator's Green Lumen, a bicycle-mounted, projection-intervention machine. The Illuminator team constructs a green rig for a green bicycle, which a team member rides around New York City to mobilize their projector and digital set-up, casting projection-based art interventions on buildings and in traffic. They successfully test it out in a not-so-busy part of town.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] On August 16, 2012, Ecuador granted diplomatic asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, after he failed to surrender to extradition by the British government for publishing secret American documents. In response, Lucky Tran and Margaret Campbell of The Illuminator team projected onto the side of the British Consulate in New York City messages supporting Assange and the free speech his website defends. Founded in 2006, WikiLeaks is a website set up to allow anyone to release anonymous documents, potentially revealing corruption, greed, and illegality from powerful companies and governments. In 2010, Chelsea Manning, a US soldier stationed in Iraq, formerly known as Bradley Manning, began sending secret military and diplomatic files to Wikileaks to be published online. Her biggest submission was 250,000 State Department diplomatic cables in fall 2011. Her online conversations with Adrian Lamo, a hacker from California, prompted him to turn her over to the FBI for damaging US national security, and she and Julian Assange were quickly arrested. As of 2012, Assange resides in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, with Ecuador intent on shielding him from likely prosecution from the UK and the US. Assange is also wanted for questioning over a 2010 rape allegation from Sweden, and his residency in the London Embassy of Ecuador allows him to avoid extradition for that, as well.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY] "Dynasty Handbag's Soggy Glasses, A Homo’s Odyssey (2014) is a feminist epic tale of self-exploration. Handbag parodies Homer’s Odyssey by revising the masculine allegory through a queer lens. In her signature blend of physical humor and camp aesthetics, she simultaneously critiques patriarchal representations of women and asserts a queer-feminist body politic. Ultimately, Handbag attempts to dismantle the master’s house through her inward journey to find home."[BIO]""Jibz Cameron is a performance/video artist and actor based in Los Angeles, California. Cameron has been heralded by The New York Times as “the funniest and most pitch perfect performance seen in years” and by The New Yorker as “outrageously smart, grotesque, and innovative.” Her work as the alter ego Dynasty Handbag has been presented at the New Museum, The Kitchen, MOCA, REDCAT, SXSW Film Festival, Performa, and BAM, as well as many international dives. Cameron has acted in works by The Wooster Group, The Residents, and Kalup Linzy, and in many web series. She has produced numerous video projects and two albums of original music. Cameron's artwork has been supported by residencies at Yaddo, The MacDowell Colony, and Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. She works as a professor of various performance and comedy related subjects.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"Martha Wilson presents a selection of artists’ books from Franklin Furnace's archive in Artists' Books Discussion at Queens College (1985). Wilson explains the importance of collecting artists’ books as other cultural institutions fail to include them as viable artworks due to their experimental form and political content. She traces the history of artists’ books from Futurism, Conceptual Art, and Fluxus, defining the avant-garde medium at the intersection of art and literature. Wilson discusses the visual, poetical, and conceptual arrangement of artists’ books and notes how these elements are performative on the page. She is later joined by Franklin Furnace Curator, Matthew Hogan, to present a selection of artists’ books from the organization’s permanent collection. This video features artists’ books by Charles Henri Ford, Kevin Osborn, Fluxus, Art Life Magazine, Ed Ruscha, Don Celender, Mark Berghash, John Baldessari, Eleanor Antin, Scott Hyde, The Apple Magazine, Warren Lehrer, Jessie Affelder, Sol Lewitt, Dick Higgins, and David Horton, among others."[BIO]Franklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas. The organization has developed a place in art history for artists’ books, temporary installation art, and performance art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"Jack Waters and Peter Cramer come of age as artists and gay men in SPEW: A New York Glamrock Operadrama (1992). Waters and Cramer express the personal as political through monologues while using visual and sonic elements to form a pastiche of opera. They reflect upon their personal and creative lives in the 1970s before the AIDS epidemic in New York City during the 1980s. Waters and Cramer use classical and avant-garde forms to merge the differing aesthetics of the Uptown and Downtown art scenes. Montage is an important element Waters and Cramer utilize throughout the performance.  This culminates most notably with the projection of the artists’ Black and White Study (1990)—an exploration of identity politics surrounding race and sexuality.  SPEW can be seen as a reflection of Waters’ and Cramer’s artistic process as partners in art and life."[BIO]"Peter Cramer is an artist and activist based in the Lower East Side of New York City. Cramer's performances, films, and installations have been featured in alternative spaces, museums, and cultural institutions across the world. His films are available through the Film-Makers' Cooperative, Fales Library and Special Collections, and Allied Productions, Inc. Cramer is an artist+ member of Visual AIDS—an organization that utilizes art to fight AIDS by provoking dialogue, supporting HIV+ artists, and preserving the legacy of the AIDS epidemic. He is the recipient of a NEA InterArts Fellowship and a grant from the US Virgin Islands Council on the Arts. Cramer received the Kathy Acker Award—a tribute given to members of the avant-garde art community who have made outstanding contributions in their discipline—established by filmmaker/photographer Clayton Patterson.

Jack Waters is a visual artist, filmmaker, writer, choreographer, and performer. Waters' artwork has been included in the exhibitions ""The Black Male"" (1995) at the Whitney Museum of American Art; ""Triple Threat"" (2008) at FRISE;  ""Not only this, but 'New language beckons us'"" (2013) at New York University; ""NOT OVER: 25 Years of Visual AIDS"" (2013) and ""Ephemera as Evidence"" (2014) at La MaMa Galleria. He appeared as the lead character in the critically acclaimed film Jason and Shirley (2015), which was co-written and co-produced with Stephen Winter and Sarah Schulman, and screened at the Museum of Modern Art, British Film Institute, and Anthology Film Archives. Water's films are included as part of the Estate Project for Artists With AIDS and the AIDS Activist Video Collection at the New York Public Library. His personal papers are held at the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University. Additional materials from his artistic career are housed at the Film-Makers' Cooperative and Allied Productions, Inc. As a journalist he has published articles on politics, cultural affairs, visual arts, film, and media. Waters was a founding contributing writer for Color Life, the news journal for LGBT and two-spirited people of Color, and for LGNY, New York City’s LGBT news bi-weekly.

As life and art partners, Waters and Cramer have collaborated on a number of projects. Together, they co-created the nonprofit arts organization Allied Productions, Inc.; served as directors of the art and activism collective ABC No Rio; and co-founded the community garden Le Petit Versailles.  Cramer and Waters were a catalytic force behind the dance and performance collective POOL, which explored contact and improvisation utilizing theater, ritual, and activism. Their work has been written about in Alternative Histories: New York Art Spaces, 1960–2010 edited by Lauren Rosati and Mary Anne Staniszewski, and Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Generation by Sarah Schulman. Waters and Cramer are the subjects of an oral history conducted by Art Spaces Archives Project at the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Their video/photo installation ""Pride 2001-We Remember"" at the New York Public Library Donnell Media Center was featured in a nationwide broadcast of In the Life on PBS. The duo has collaborated on projects with Barbara Hammer, Geoff Hendricks, Sur Rodney (Sur), and Inbred Hybrid Collective. Their work has been featured at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New Museum, Center for Contemporary Culture Barcelona, FRISE, Anthology Film Archives, and MIX NYC, among other venues.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"In Swimmin' the River (1987-1997), Billy Curmano swims the length of the Mississippi River as a political gesture to advocate for the freedom from toxicity. Spanning from the headwaters to the Gulf of Mexico, Curmano uses the river as an artistic medium and political landscape to discuss environmental issues. He wades in the Mississippi as the sunlight glistens and the wind shapes the tide. Each stroke Curmano takes is an attempt to reclaim the river under the banner of art and work toward an agenda for climate justice. The ecology of Curmano’s swim can largely be seen as an extended metaphor of pollution—one in which our existence has become contaminated by the effects of eco-capitalism."[BIO]"Billy X. Curmano’s art practice examines issues of consequence with absurdist flair. Formally trained as a painter and sculptor, Curmano fuses the performative with traditional objects. He became the first person to swim the Mississippi River spanning from the source at Lake Itasca, through the center of the continental United States, to the Gulf of Mexico. This performance resulted in the Hampton Award Winning documentary Swimming the River (1987-1997), which brought the artist critical acclaim. Curmano extended the swim by performing excerpts of it in the traveling exhibition Objects Collected and Created in the Course of a Swim (1995-1997). His work has been exhibited and collected extensively from Austria’s III Vienna Graphikbiennale to New York’s Museum of Modern Art Library. Mark Pezinger Verlag published Billy X. Curmano Futurism’s Bastard Son (2012), an artist book that features a compilation of Curmano’s performance art. Amused journalists have dubbed Curmano as “The Court Jester of Southeastern Minnesota” with comparisons to P.T. Barnum, Andy Warhol, Marcel Duchamp and even... a happy otter.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"DISBAND performs a set of politically charged feminist anthems in DISBAND at Franklin Furnace (1979). Comprised of Donna Henes, Barbara Kruger, Diane Torr, and Martha Wilson, the all-girl band of artists addresses issues affecting women through song and movement. Utilizing gestures seen in social protests, the members of DISBAND yell, clap, stomp, walk, and jump to combat patriarchy. Their collective body functions as both instrument and medium to fight sexism in art, politics, and society. Together, these acts conjure an agenda that calls for the evolution of feminist consciousness."[BIO]"Active in the downtown art scene in Manhattan from 1978-82, the members of  DISBAND screamed, sang, and stomped through the heyday of New York  City’s new- and no-wave scenes, blurring the line between performance art and live  music. Members included Barbara Ess, Ilona Granet, Donna Henes, Daile Kaplan,  Barbara Kruger, Ingrid Sischy, Diane Torr, and Martha Wilson. Mirroring the chaos and  temporality of that era, the band sang such songs as “The End,” “Five More Years,”  “Every Day Same Old Way,” “Get Rebel,” “Sad,” “Iran-y” and “DOW.” They also  addressed their status as women through songs such as “Girls’ Bill of Rights,” “Hey  Baby,” “Fashions,” and “Look at My Dick.” DISBAND has performed in New York venues such as MOMA PS1, The Kitchen,  Mudd Club, TR3, and nationally at Hallwalls, LAICA, and Chicago’s  Museum of Contemporary Art. In 1980 DISBAND toured Italy with Laurie Anderson,  Chris Burden, and others. The group reunited in 2008 to perform at MOMA PS1 as part of the touring exhibition “Wack! Art and the Feminist Revolution.”

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] This is the story of two twin boys with identical thoughts and feelings. When the war arrives, their mother abandons them in their grandmother’s care. Far from love and certainty, they begin a process of self-education that will allow them to survive hunger, pride, humiliation, corruption, abuse, death, and ultimately… solitude.

[BIO] Teatrocinema is a multidisciplinary collective of artists who seek beauty, poetry and narration of image and musicality, fusing languages and techniques from theater and film. In 1987, we founded La Troppa (plays: Lobo, Viaje al Centro de la Tierra, Gemelos…). In 2006, we regrouped and founded Teatrocinema (plays: Sin Sangre, Historia de Amor…).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Ache What Make combines urgent poetry, ritual theatre, and
layered song to reflect on disaster, dignity, and death-defying love.
Whether she's talking about post-earthquake Haiti, conjuring Jean-Michel
Basquiat, or recounting her run-in with a skinhead on a crowded city train,
Moïse testifies to stubborn compassion and a playful will to
live.
[BIO] Lenelle Moïse creates jazz-infused, politicized performances about
Haitian-American identity and the intersection of race, class, gender,
sexuality, memory and magic. Moïse is a Huntington Theatre Company
Playwriting Fellow. Her plays and solo performances include MERIT,
EXPATRIATE and WOMB-WORDS, THIRSTING. She is the author of HAITI
GLASS.

ends forty years later with punishment for their perpetrators.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Manifesting Dance is an evening of dance pieces choreographed
and performed by Montreal dance artists and choreographers. NUNOUNENON,
George Stamos: Through Nunounenon the collaborators seek to open new space
for dialogue and promote alternative approaches to gender and power
dynamics in contemporary dance. Turning clichés inside out, Nunounenon
reveals the absurdity of hyper-sexualized bodies and discrepancies between
idealism and reality while affirming the right for every body to hold
power.

NGS ("Native Girl Syndrome"): Lara Kramer’s new creation NGS (“Native Girl Syndrome”) dives into street culture, as enacted in a raw theatrical performance by Karina Iraola and Angie Cheng. Their drug filled, disassociated personas take the audience on a dynamic journey of addiction, loss, and alienation.

CORPS.RELATIONS: The piece CORPS.RELATIONS is a duet between my body and my head. The work explores the gap between the logical representation of reality and the immediate embodiment of impulses, creating an absurd illusion for unity.

De/Liberate Gestures: Movement is about engaging in the here-and-now. For choreographer and interpreter Zab Maboungou, her choreographic vocabulary and personal poetics emerge from those profound musical forms that, through and beyond the instrument, are sustained by our steps and resonate in our gestures. Her dance is a dance for thought.

[BIO] George Stamos is a Montreal based choreographer known for his trans-disciplinary creations that are at once physically dynamic, ritualistic and thought provoking. Gender politics and a belief that the mind and body are each aspects of one conscious organism have been underlying themes in his artistic research.

Lara Kramer is the artistic director and choreographer of Lara Kramer Danse, based in Montreal. She is a First Nation artist whose work is intimately linked to memory and her Aboriginal roots. Her work is political and potent, often examining political issues surrounding Canada and First Nations Peoples.  

Maria Kefirova is a Bulgarian born performer and a performance maker based since 1992 in Montreal. Parallel to her work as a performer, she has been developing her own artistic practice combining dance, theatre, performance and video.

Zab Maboungou is the founder of the renowned Zab Maboungou/Compagnie Danse Nyata Nyata. She is a performing and choreographic artist, and a philosophy professor who has distinguished herself on all artistic and cultural action fronts. Zab Maboungou is viewed as a dance pioneer in Canada. A unique itinerary reflecting the aesthetic with great poetic power.

director Nelda Castillo’s artistic and pedagogical experience. Since its
inception, it has explored Cuba’s cultural memory and confronted its
reality with a unique theatrical language through plays, performances and

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] The Midway Mermaid is an exploration of the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch and its impact on the ecosystems at Midway Island. While
singing an operatic lament, a mermaid is erased by a wave of plastic
bottles, utensils, and other waste created by Encuentro participants over
the course of the week and incorporated on site into the performance.
[BIO] Jasmine Presson combines classical operatic training with
experimental theatre. Caught at the intersection of antiquated “high
art” and contemporary performance practices, Presson’s work seamlessly
fuses opera with burlesque, improv, and performance art in reenactments of
imagery from pop culture and the operatic canon.

voice, specifically focusing on tonality and rhythm. The youth students
rehearse their poems and provide constructive feedback for each other. A
brief interview is conducted with poet mentor Terry Taplin following the

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Scourge fuses hip hop, spoken word, and live music to explore
the narrow space between history, myth, and speculation. Throughout, Marc
Bamuthi Joseph tells the story of Haiti—the poorest nation in the Western
Hemisphere with a long and violent history of exploitation. The plot
revolves around two kids torn between their Caribbean roots and growing up
in the urban United States. This nonlinear collage of lives, myths, and
experiences has echoes of Shakespeare, anchored by Joseph’s performance
as Grandpere—a first generation, world-weary Prospero, determined to
leave his Americanized grandchildren a sense of their place in history.


To help realize the complex themes of the piece, Joseph merges urgent
voices, music, and movement through collaborations with Rennie Harris, John
Santos, Adia Whitaker, and Kamilah Forbes. He also worked with three young
writers from Youth Speaks on the performance. Maxence Denis, a
French/Haitian visual artist, shot the documentary footage of Haiti in the
piece. Three live musicians provide a multilayered sound accompaniment from
the cacopohonous to the bluesy, mixing beat-boxing rhythms with Caribbean
tunes. The dancing in the piece is a mixture of African-based dance and hip
hop. Propelled by the music, the choreography works with the text and moves
the narrative forward in the performance. 

[BIO] Marc Bamuthi Joseph is one of America’s vital voices in
performance, arts education, and artistic curation.  ln fall 2007, Bamuthi
graced the cover of Smithsonian Magazine after being named one of
America’s Top Young lnnovators in the Arts and Sciences. He is the
artistic director of the 7-part HBO documentary Russell Simmons Presents
Brave New Voices and an inaugural recipient of the United States Artists
Rockefeller Fellowship, which annually recognizes 50 of the country’s
“greatest living artists.” He is the 2011 Alpert Award winner in
Theater, and in April 2012, he was one of 21 artists to be named to the
inaugural class of Doris Duke Artists. He currently is completing new works
for the Philadelphia Opera and South Coast Repertory Theater while serving
as Director of Performing Arts at YBCA.

After appearing on Broadway as a young actor, Joseph has developed several
poetry-based works for the stage that have toured across the United States,
Europe, Asia, and Africa. Joseph’s current evening-length project, red
black and green: a blues, documents the eco-equity movement toward
green-collar jobs in Black neighborhoods and is among the anchors of the
Kennedy Center’s 2013-14 programming season. Bamuthi’s next piece in
this artistic vein is called /peh-LO tah/, and is a Balinese-style shadow
play that examines global economies and sexual identities through the lens
of soccer’s World Cup. He is the founding Program Director of the
exemplary non-profit Youth Speaks, and is a co-founder of Life Is Living, a
national series of one-day festivals designed to activate under-resourced

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Tree City Legends is a multidisciplinary theater work that
combines post-hip-hop aesthetics, urban folklore, and Asian Pacific
Islander cultural references with live music, parable, and myth. It
explores Pacific Islander American immigrants’ feelings of rootlessness
and abandonment by tracing the lives of the Kane brothers (Sum, Junie,
Denizen, and Min). Biblical imagery, multi-perspective narrative, and a
sense of longing underpin Junie's story—part Bildungsroman, part blues
song, part Book of Jonah remix—and haunt him as a folk-singing sensation.
The bitter realities of the block and a ghostly past loom in the background
as the brothers struggle to make sense of a world that was not made with
them in mind. Their connection to each other is expressed as an invented
language—a way of survival on the margins of the cultural page.

[BIO] Dennis Kim (Denizen Kane) is a creative writer, underground rapper,
and spoken word artist. His early public performances coincided with the
pre-millennium rise of slam poetry/spoken-word culture at Chicago's Mental
Graffiti poetry series, then convened weekly at the Mad Bar. Kim clinched a
spot on the National Slam team for Mental Graffiti in 1999. Shortly
thereafter, he co-founded the Asian-American spoken word group I Was Born
with Two Tongues. In 2000, Kim co-founded Typical Cats, a hip-hop
collective that issued two CDs, one eponymously titled and a second titled

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Chasing Mehserle begins where Chinaka Hodge’s first critically
acclaimed play, Mirrors in Every Corner, left off. All of the characters of
a Black/multi-racial family in Oakland return in the second installment to
consider the infamous murder of East Oakland resident Oscar Grant. As a way
of investigating communal response to the death of Oscar Grant, the
playwright examines race, class, gender, and privilege through the lens of
the main character, Watts.

originally from Oakland, California.  She graduated from NYU’s Gallatin
School of Individualized Study and received an MFA in Writing for Film and
TV from USC’s prestigious School of Cinematic Arts.  She is the recipient

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In Spiritrials, addiction, religion, and the law intersect in an
exploration of the criminal justice system.  Blurring the lines between hip
hop and theater, the piece chronicles the journey of Dahlak Brathwaite’s
experience with criminalization, along with his struggle to be vindicated
and decriminalized in the eyes of law and society. Spiritrials works
through the personal shame of criminal stigmatization to examine the
factors--both internal and external--that have misplaced him in what
appears to be a cultural rite of passage.

[BIO] Dahlak is a multi-faceted hip-hop artist that maximizes his abilities
as musician, actor, poet, and educator within the transformational space of
the theater. Since launching into the national spoken word scene by winning
the Brave New Voices international poetry slam (as now seen on HBO), Dahlak
has performed on the Tavis Smiley Radio show and the past two seasons of
Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry Jam. Dahlak has worked with Broadway
veteran and Rockefeller fellow Marc Bamuthi Joseph by writing and
performing in his critically acclaimed plays Scourge and Word Becomes
Flesh. As a member of the organization iLL-Literacy, Dahlak has showcased
his seamless blend of hip hop, theatre, and spoken word throughout the
United States and overseas. Dahlak has released three musical projects,
which include, most noteably, his full-length album Dual Consciousness.

Billie Holiday’s classic hit “Summertime” using her own lyrics to
reflect upon contemporary racial issues and the Black Lives Matter social
movement. Willis composed and performed this original piece in response to
Marc Bamuthi Joseph's red, black and GREEN: a blues, which was presented
alongside and in conjunction with the exhibition The Colored Museum by
Theater Gates. The excerpt, performed by Willis, was commissioned by IcTus
Gallery in San Francisco for the closing production of Joseph's play.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Arthur Avilés uses juxtaposition as a choreographic structure
for the movement in The Brightly Lit Box (1989). Performed by Avilés and
Lisa Race, the dancers engage in simple movement phrases set in contrast to
a complex percussive composition by John Bergamo. Avilés runs, jumps, and
rolls, while Race kicks, spins, and bends, forming an asymmetry to each
other across time and space. There are moments when both dancers reflect
each other's vocabulary, not as a duet, but as a conversation of movement.
While the movements in the dance are fairly similar, Avilés is interested
in how the choreographic structure plays out on differently gendered
bodies, specifically the juxtaposition of male/female and the politics of
such binaries in dance. 

[BIO] Arthur Avilés is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer based in
the Bronx, New York. Avilés was a member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane
Dance Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur Avilés Typical
Theatre, a dance company based in the Bronx that seeks to create work that
plays on the margins of gay and Latino cultures. The company is housed at
the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), which was founded in 1998 by
Avilés and Charles Rice-González, a creative writer and community
activist. Avilés’ work utilizes aspects of theater and dance, often
taking the structure of stories from existing classics and reconfiguring
them in order to express the felt, actual, and fantastical lives of queer
Latinos living in the ghetto. He received a Bachelors of Arts in
Theater/Dance from Bard College under the direction of Jean Churchill,
Lenore Latimer, Albert Reid, Susan Osberg, and Aileen Passloff. He was
awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater in 2015.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Arthur Avilés’ Arturella (Excerpt, 2003) is a queer
interpretation of the fairy tale Cinderella. Avilés uses his
“autobiographical fantasy” method to recast the classic tale as a gay
romance set in the South Bronx’s Latino community. He integrates Spanish
and Spanglish into the narrative and assigns Latino names to all the
characters in the fairy tale. Most of the movement in the dance is copied
from the cartoon characters featured in Walt Disney’s motion picture
Cinderella. It also features traditional Puerto Rican danza steps, as well
as movement taken from West Side Story. The dance’s soundtrack is a
collage of music and sounds taken from Disney’s Cinderella.


Throughout the dance, the young effeminate Arturella (Arthur Avilés) is
searching for community.  Adopted by the evil step Maéva (Elizabeth
Marrero) after his father died, Arturella faces hardships surrounding race,
economics, and sexuality. Arturella perseveres, however, with the help of
the Fairy God Maéva (Marrero) and finds his way to the Prince’s sweet-15
party (quinceañero). Arturella and the Prince (George Merced) dance
together, but Arturella abruptly leaves the party. He has to return home to
his evil step Maéva and evil stepsisters (Kaila Cordova and Alberto
Denis), leaving a rainbow ribbon behind for the Prince to find him. The
Prince searches for Arturella after the party and later rescues him from
his evil family with King Maéva (Marrero). As the fairy tale ends, the
Prince and Arturella express their love for each other, punctuated by a
long kiss in silence.

[BIO] Arthur Avilés is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer based in
the Bronx, New York. Avilés was a member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane
Dance Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur Avilés Typical
Theatre, a dance company based in the Bronx that seeks to create work that
plays on the margins of gay and Latino cultures. The company is housed at
the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), which was founded in 1998 by
Avilés and Charles Rice-González, a creative writer and community
activist. Avilés’ work utilizes aspects of theater and dance, often
taking the structure of stories from existing classics and reconfiguring
them in order to express the felt, actual, and fantastical lives of queer
Latinos living in the ghetto. He received a Bachelors of Arts in
Theater/Dance from Bard College under the direction of Jean Churchill,
Lenore Latimer, Albert Reid, Susan Osberg, and Aileen Passloff. He was
awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater in 2015.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Arthur Avilés performs Pichon: Ritual Dance of Fire (1999) as
part of a benefit for the Martha Graham School. One of many incarnations of
Pichon, Avilés dances to electronic house music wearing a red velvet dress
inspired by Martha Graham—a pioneering modern dancer and choreographer in
the United States. He combines rave dance moves with classical ballet forms
throughout the piece. At one moment Avilés is dancing arabesques and
chaînés turns; the next he is performing electro and tecktonik moves. The
movement is complimented by the musical lyric, “The world turns 'round
and 'round, the world turns 'round and 'round.” While dancing on the
floor, Avilés’ red dress falls, revealing his penis to the audience.
Avilés’ nudity becomes a queer act that affirms his sexuality and racial
identity on stage (as evidenced in many of his dances). He continues with
such graphic movement phrases and patterns until the dance ends.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] Arthur Avilés’ REAL MEN (2004) confronts the politics of
race, gender, and sexuality in contemporary dance. For this piece, Avilés
casts dancers of different racial backgrounds and sexual identities. The
performers have movement backgrounds in modern dance, jazz, and ballet, and
various levels of formal training. One performer has no previous training
and appears on stage for the first time. Furthermore, all the dancers in
the piece are from the Bronx—a political gesture by Avilés to place
Uptown bodies on the Downtown stage. 

In REAL MEN, nude male brown bodies oscillate between movement phrases and
contact forms. The movement derives from Avilés’ Initial Response—a
choreographic strategy that uses non-thinking to create a series of
movement phrases. As the male dancers slowly undulate across the floor, a
female dancer enters wearing a tuxedo and mustache. The dancers perform the
same movements together, blurring the lines of gender. Here, Avilés works
to confront the historical gender binaries in dance by challenging the ways
in which gender is perceived and performed on stage. 

REAL MEN premiered as part of the all-male dance series “In the Company
of Men.” Avilés was the first choreographer to invite a woman to perform
on stage in the series. He asserts that REAL MEN “is as much a social
justice act as it is a dance piece. It is about men of color and
connection. REAL MEN is a unique dance piece for its time.”

dance’s title. Throughout the performance, Avilés continuously moves in
time and space while asserting his racial, sexual, and national identity.
He dances nude as a political gesture to critique contemporary dance
aesthetics and to expose his gay, Puerto Rican body amid the AIDS crisis.
Avilés also expresses tension surrounding his self-proclaimed identity as

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] (Semi)Novissíssimos, ainda sem nome examines the production of body image through advertisement and other media. In this piece the dancers manipulate their bodies to seduce, exhibit, distort, and manipulate themselves, referring icons of mass media in Brazil and around the world.

[BIO] CoMteMpu's was founded in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, in 2005 by artists interested in co-creation and collaboration through dance, performance, urban interventions, and body art. They began their work together as graduates and students of the School of Dance at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), before spreading their works beyond the university walls to create and develop a practice that crosses and exceeds language and body techniques, affects and politics. Since 2011, the group became a platform to bring together artists from three Brazilian cities: Salvador, Olinda, and Rio de Janeiro. Together, they discovered new ways of working together at a distance. The artists of CoMteMpu's call themselves "zezas."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Bria brisa BRISURA explores the impossibility of touch, processes of alterity, and passages of force through the body. The performers test limits of gesture through physical acts of breaking, violence, gagging, and stuttering.

[BIO] CoMteMpu's was founded in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, in 2005 by artists interested in co-creation and collaboration through dance, performance, urban interventions, and body art. They began their work together as graduates and students of the School of Dance at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), before spreading their works beyond the university walls to create and develop a practice that crosses and exceeds language and body techniques, affects and politics. Since 2011, the group became a platform to bring together artists from three Brazilian cities: Salvador, Olinda, and Rio de Janeiro. Together, they discovered new ways of working together at a distance. The artists of CoMteMpu's call themselves "zezas."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SYNOPSIS] Obras de Uma Carta Anônima explores relations of instability and security through a series of four discussions on authorship, vulnerability, training as cultural dressage, and reception. The images, movements, and texts used in this piece came from the autobiographical experiments of the co-creators.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Out-doors is a dance intervention in urban space that developed from research on the "Plastic-Body-Object-Thing." The Zezas exhibit, disguise, manipulate, distort, and subvert commercial advertisements for their "product-body" in the midst of traffic, monuments, buildings, and passersby.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] PEBA is an integration of dance, performance art, and sound architecture that investigates the community and body that emerges through local demonstrations, folguedos, carnival, and street festivals between the Brazilian states of Pernambuco (PE) and Bahia (BA). The neologism that results from playing with the initials of the two states [PE+BA] also refers to a local Brazilian term, "peba", an adjective to qualify something precarious, low-quality, and provisional. Moreover, "peba" is an indigenous word that means short or very small (usually attributed to animals). Through the interaction of bodies, light, and sound, PEBA creates new heterotopias (or dystopias) that exist in neither Pernambuco nor Bahia.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] Safo is a Brazilian local term for somebody that always escapes; it's connection to the Greek poet Sappho is mere coincidence (or maybe not). This dance is a Dadaist collage, which uses irony and subversive corporality to trouble the imaginary of the modern political subject. 

[BIO] CoMteMpu's was founded in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, in 2005 by artists interested in co-creation and collaboration through dance, performance, urban interventions, and body art.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):

[SYNOPSIS] This piece is an excerpt from “ZeZOU - Zonas de Ocupação Urbana v.3” (ZeZOU - Zone of Urban Ocupations, 3rd edition), organized by CoMteMpus in partnership with Coletivo Lugar Comum. This excerpt features two actions of ZeZOU v.3, which took place in downtown Recife. The first is a durational performance by Rua Nova in which she takes three hours to walk less than 100 meters. The second is a picnic on Duarte Coelho Bridge during sunset. Both performances create new zones of occupation in Recife, opening a discussion on the use of urban space and the velocity of bodies in the face of mass capitalism and processes of gentrification.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"The Green Lumen's maiden voyage was a successful intervention that shone a line of light on the crisis of climate change. This action, which took place September 21, 2013, was in solidarity with 350.org., an online-based nonprofit organization, working toward building a global, grassroots climate movement by creating online campaigns and mass public actions to hold world leaders accountable and to actually address climate change. The Illuminator's projections showcased the collective's opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline, a 1,179 mile (1,897 km) pipeline running from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska. This pipeline would carry almost a million barrels of oil each day into the U.S., allowing for the nation to decrease its dependency on Middle Eastern oil. It is incredibly controversial due to its likely damaging effects on the environment, with a possibility for oil and chemical spills affecting the fragile ecosystems with which the pipeline intersects. The U.S. decision to approve or reject the further development of the Keystone XL Pipeline was also seen as symbolic of the U.S.'s energy future and whether the country would continue to use fossil fuels or transition to clean, renewable energy. The Illuminator cast their projections using the Green Lumen, a green metal rig fastened onto a bicycle allowing for easy mobile usage of their projector."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Since emerging from the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2012, the collective has fought to smash the myths of the information industry, and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. www.theilluminator.org"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"The Guerrilla Girls, pioneers of art intervention, celebrated their 30th anniversary in May 2015 with an exhibition at Abrons Art Center in Lower East Side in Manhattan, New York City. This exhibit opened alongside a sticker campaign critiquing art and the 1% of humanity that owns the vast majority of the world's wealth—the über-rich elite. In a collaborative projection with the Illuminator, the Guerrilla Girls also intervened at the re-opening of the Whitney Museum, a modern art museum in Lower Manhattan. This video explores their campaign and projection through a soft blend of heist film and cinema verité, a style of documentary filmmaking used to highlight truths about certain subjects behind the lens of false reality. Through its combination of voice and image, Not Ready to Make Nice offers a glimpse into this anonymous group of artists and the message behind their work. At a time when income inequality dominates discussions around the country, the Guerrilla Girls question the disparate costs between building museums, buying art and the unliveable wages paid to workers in the art world."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"Illuminating Donald Trump: Trump vs the 99% was a pointed critique of the notorious businessman's decision to build a golf course for elite jet-setters on the eastern coast of Scotland. Trump started constructing this golf course as the first part of a luxury resort project and received much criticism for choosing land legally protected by the Scottish government in order to preserve its environment and fragile ecosystem. Throughout the golf course development and construction, Trump was embroiled in numerous legal battles with homeowners whose land he bought with the intention of seizing the additional land around them, thereby increasing their property values tremendously and making it so they could no longer afford their homes. Trump's insistence to continue the project also greatly affected the planned construction of a wind turbine farm located near the property. His plan was to eliminate it altogether so the turbines would not block the golfers' view, and in effect ridding the town of much needed renewable energy. When the government decided to move ahead with building the wind farm, Trump sued the Scottish government, creating an expensive legal battle. The Illuminator's projections of videos and protest graphics shed light on the capitalist arrogance of the Trump golf course, and cheered on the efforts of Occupy Wall Street, the activist organization speading a worldwide message to dismantle the oppressive system granting the über-rich—people like Donald Trump—power worldwide."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"Presented at Parsons' 2012 Art in Odd Places Festival, the same week student debt surpassed credit card debt in the U.S. by $1 trillion, Illuminating Student Debt engaged with students and commuters to consider the diverse ways student debt affects our lives. Art in Odd Places is a public art project started in 1996 and explores connections between pedestrian traffic, public space, and art interventions. The Illuminator highlighted student debt along the intersection of 14th Street and 6th Avenue in Lower Manhattan. The projection asked passersby to send text message responses to the question “What does student debt mean to you?” in order to create critical dialogue and potentially lay the groundwork for developing solutions. The projection also revealed the harsh realities of living with student debt, highlighting facts such as the 10% drop in average salary for college graduates currently in the workforce, and also that many college graduates aren't yet able to live financially independent and stable lives post-graduation. In the United States, student debt has become a huge crisis, with the average college student graduating with approximately $30,000 in debt or more. Additionally, since 1982, tuition costs have risen over 500%, making it nearly impossible for current college students and recent graduates to pay for their education the way previous generations would have been able to thirty years earlier."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"On the Illuminator's debut night, March 3, 2012, the collective cast projections of the Occupy Wall Street logo "99%" onto the side of the Chase Bank building at the busy intersection of 4th Street and 6th Avenue in Lower Manhattan. Broadcasting the logo onto a centrally located, highly trafficked intersection helped reflect the Illuminator's ongoing commitment to hold the New York City public accountable and aware of the Occupy movement in highly visible ways. Occupy Wall Street began roughly six months prior, capturing worldwide attention as a global campaign against social and economic inequality, corporate greed, and corruption. The "99%" signifies the overwhelming majority of global citizens who do not hold nearly as immense social and political power as the richest 1% of the world's population does. Similarly, the text "We are the 99%" remains symbolic of the Illuminator's solidarity and identification with Occupy Wall Street's mission to eliminate a global plutocracy, a system based on giving power only to the wealthy. This projections-based public art intervention also took place in collaboration with the +Brigades, a faction of Occupy Wall Street activists that utilizes engaging, sensational, and accessible protest tactics/public performance art in order to spread the message of Occupy Wall Street."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"This footage of “The People’s Pad” documents the debut of a thresholding and mapping software used to transform ink on paper into projectable digital content. The People's Pad was first used at 5 Pointz, a historical graffiti mecca in Long Island City, Queens immediately after its public and highly controversial white washing. The outdoor art exhibit space, utilizing the exterior of a factory warehouse, is named 5Pointz for bringing together the five boroughs of New York City in one central hub for graffiti and street art. However, its impact has been worldwide, as 5Pointz was affectionately called the "United Nations of Graffiti" for its global prestige and popularity. Graffiti is often criminalized as public vandalism within urban spaces, historically associated with communities of color using graffiti to protest institutionalized racism and economic oppression. With gentrification sweeping New York City, the owners of 5Pointz decided to develop the warehouses into luxury condominiums, stating that they had always wanted to do so and that the murals were simply a temporary allowance. The New York City Planning Commission voted to begin developing the condos, whereas the Landmark Committee vehemently opposed it, citing that the location was a historical monument to the legacy and culture of New York graffiti artists. On November 19, 2013, the hundreds of thousands of feet of graffiti accumulated over twenty years were painted white overnight and effectively erased. The Illuminator's People's Pad hoped to bring back the longstanding legacy of public art to the area in a way that could not be criminalized and publicly contested the way graffiti often is."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"On April 12, 2015, No Red Tape partnered with the Illuminator to project messages such as “Rape Happens Here” onto the facade of Columbia University’s Low Library. No Red Tape drew from previous Columbia University-based efforts to protest the university's inaction regarding rape cases, utilizing more radical methods to bring awareness to the issue. Broadcasting text onto a centrally located, iconic building on campus like the Low Library, reflects No Red Tape’s ongoing commitment to holding the university accountable in public and highly visible ways. Through actions such as public rallies and interruptions of prospective student information sessions, the group continually aims to bring conversations about gender-based violence into the public sphere. The projection also reflected the central role of art in the movement against campus sexual violence. Over the course of 2014, the most visible example of such artistic tactics was Columbia visual arts student Emma Sulkowicz’s Carry That Weight, her thesis project where she carried around her twin-sized dorm mattress everywhere, from class to the bathroom, for the entire school year, focusing on the emotional weight she must carry as a survivor of campus rape, as well as the weight of the university's inaction to prosecute and expel her rapist, another Columbia student. Actions like the Illuminator projection continue to celebrate art as a form of protest and as a way of highlighting the voices of survivors and activists who are too often silenced and ignored."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"On August 4, 2012, the Illuminator beamed projections of the Occupy Wall Street logo onto building facades in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a predominantly Mexican immigrant and Mexican-American neighborhood facing unfair rent increases in light of the gentrification sweeping the city. Gentrification is the process of revonating deteriorating urban neighborhoods by pushing out lower-income residents to make way for more affluent ones, and rent increase is an effective way of doing so. Text and visuals of Occupy Wall Street, a global campaign against social and economic inequality, and corporate greed and corruption, highlighted the movement's solidarity with the rent strikers of Sunset Park, and to portray the message that affordable housing is a human right, not an economic liability. The Illuminator chose to cast projections at the corner of 42nd Street and 5th Avenue as it is an ideal location for pedestrians in Sunset Park, and is one of the highest points in Brooklyn to view projections alongside the Manhattan skyline. In a city as expensive as New York, the Rent Strike projections created a visual emphasis on the need for economic equality. The project was created in collaboration with the Overpass Light Brigade, an art activism group based in Wisconsin that uses string lights to write illuminated messages onto wooden panels, and then holds up these light panels in public spaces to make a highly visible statement on a variety of social justice issues. The intervention in Sunset Park was not only live streamed, but also occurred at the same time as an Overpass Light Brigade intervention taking place in Madison, Wisconsin on a highway overpass."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Since emerging from the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2012, the collective has fought to smash the myths of the information industry, and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. www.theilluminator.org"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"The Illuminator, in collaboration with the Occupy Wall Street Light Brigade, projected a videogame protesting corporate tax evasion onto the side of the Citibank building in Union Square, in lower Manhattan on April 15, 2013. The Occupy Wall Street Light Brigade, based out of Wisconsin, is an art activism group that uses string lights to write illuminated messages onto wooden panels, and then holds up these light panels in public spaces to make highly visible statements about Occupy Wall Street, the global campaign to eliminate economic inequality and injustice. These panels, reading "Tax Evader," were displayed alongside the "Tax Evaders" videogame made to highlight the Citibank tax evasion scandal. As discovered by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Citigroup, and its subsidiary Citibank, avoided paying $11.5 billion in taxes by holding billions of dollars in offshore accounts. The U.S. Public Interest Research Group functions as a nonprofit entity advocating for corporate tax reform. In April 2013 they released a report revealing which profitable corporations are guilty of tax evasion, providing Occupy Wall Street with the opportunity to publicize this information as evidence that economic justice must be served."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Since emerging from the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2012, the collective has fought to smash the myths of the information industry, and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. www.theilluminator.org"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]"On the evening of March 20, 2012, the Illuminator van drove around Union Square in lower Manhattan and projected the "99%" logo of the Occupy Wall Street movement in solidarity with their global campaign against social and economic inequality, corporate greed, and corruption. The term "99%" signifies the overwhelming majority of global citizens who do not hold as much social and political power as the richest 1% of the world's population. Projecting the logo in such a busy, commercial part of New York exemplified the Illuminator's solidarity and identification with Occupy Wall Street's mission to eliminate a global plutocracy, a system based on giving power only to the wealthy. The Illuminator also played music to accompany the projections, including "Fight the Power" by Hip-Hop group Public Enemy, a song well-known for its anti-establishment and radical political message. Huge crowds were drawn to the art projections in Union Square, as it is a popular tourist destination, a highly trafficked subway stop, and a location famous for hosting large and frequent public political demonstrations."[BIO]"The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention. Since emerging from the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2012, the collective has fought to smash the myths of the information industry, and shine a light on the urgent issues of our time. www.theilluminator.org"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS] In this collectively created play, La Candelaria wanted to
address the problem of social and political violence in Colombia through an
exploration of both verbal and non-verbal languages (the latter given
special emphasis). 'El Paso' looks like a road bar, a place where people go
to rest or have something to eat while traveling across the country. The
truth is it is a kind of no-place surrounded by violence and social
conflicts. The characters constantly refer to issues from the outside as if
political violence and other danger exist only outside, and the bar was a
haven. However, violence makes its way into the bar: two shady characters
irrupt in the bar's status quo, forcefully involving the patrons, employees
and passers-by in their shady business. The people at the bar need to
negotiate their complicity or resistance to the illegal activities
performed by the two newcomers, who with their guns and money set an
atmosphere of fear and violence in an otherwise uneventful crossroad's
'cantina'. 
[BIO] La Candelaria was founded in 1966 by a group of independent artists
and intellectuals who came from experimental theater and the broader
Colombian cultural movement. Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria
(www.teatrolacandelaria.org.co) is one of Colombian theater's most
innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular
audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore,
situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most
compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva'
(collective creation), addressing the acute social and political problems
of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of
Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of
theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and
languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire,
experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic
creation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] Martha Wilson explores the effects of camera presence in this
video compilation of her solo performances. She uses film as a political
medium to record the temporal, visceral, and spacial dimensions of her
subjectivity as a female artist. As both filmmaker and performer, Wilson
asserts political autonomy over her image and counters phallocentric
notions of the female body. She reverses the male gaze by becoming a
subject of her own desire, while challenging standards of beauty.
Wilson’s subjective agency places her identity as a woman artist front
and center, a radical position that challenged the aesthetic practices of
male conceptual artists in the 1970s.
[BIO] Martha Wilson is a pioneering gallery director and feminist artist
who creates innovative photographic and video works that explore her female
subjectivity. Wilson founded Franklin Furnace in 1976, an artist-run space
that champions the exploration, promotion, and preservation of artist
books, temporary installation, performance art, as well as online works.
She has been described by New York Times critic Holland Cotter as one of
'the half-dozen most important people for art in downtown Manhattan in the
1970s.' Wilson has received fellowships for performance art from the
National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts;
Bessie and Obie awards for commitment to artists’ freedom of expression;
a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts; a Richard Massey
Foundation-White Box Arts and Humanities Award; and an Honorary Doctor of
Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SYNOPSIS]

'Arborite House Dress parallels the conformity of the 1950s with the rise
of the New Right. The pro/antagonist defends herself against racial and
economic difference by clothing herself in the domestic architecture of the
times: the house/dress is her shimmering, clean fortress and her prison.
Throughout the piece, she reveals her fears (such as gravity, or the fear
that 'parts of my dangerously sagging self might end up in bad
neighborhoods') and her fantasies (border town romances, getting down with
dirt, and the elimination of her family so she will have time to devote
herself more fully to being a homemaker). 

The wearable sculpture/costume has been exhibited at many art galleries and
has been purchased by The Winnipeg Art Gallery as part of their permanent
collection.

This piece is part of The Dress Series (1989-1996), a group of performances
that explore the dress as a female ceremonial costume and icon of
femininity. In these pieces, cloth is replaced by unlikely materials,
creating juxtaposition, new meanings and upending expectations. All
costumes have been fabricated by Dempsey and Millan.

'Have you ever noticed that if you wash the floor in the morning, by
nightfall it looks just the same as before you started? That you can do all
of the dishes and, in a matter of hours, someone has gone and dirtied them
again? That children are little grime magnets, picking up all manner of
stubborn stains and bringing them home again? Well, I've been thinking. If
I could get rid of my family, it would effectively cut my work load by
60%.' '


[BIO]
Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among
Canada’s best-known performance artists. They were catapulted into the
international spotlight in their 20s with the performance and film We’re
Talking Vulva. Since then, their live work and videos have been exhibited
in diverse venues as far-ranging as women's centers in Sri Lanka to the
Museum of Modern Art in New York City. This Winnipeg-based duo has created
installations (such as Archaeology and You for the Royal Ontario Museum),
public art pieces (such as One Gay City, the subject of a Manitoba Human
Rights Commission challenge) and books (such as Bedtime Stories for the
Edge of the World, Arbeiter Ring Press). To most, however, they are known
simply as the Lesbian Rangers of Lesbian National Parks and Services. Their
humorous, feminist and provocative work has been acclaimed as “one of the
high-points of contemporary Canadian artistic production” (Border
Crossings Magazine). Dempsey and Millan are the recipients of many awards,
most proudly the Canadian Museums Association Award for Outstanding
Publication and the Manitoba Arts Council Special Prize for Innovation and
Excellence.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]In the summer of 2007 (40 years after the Summer of Love), Dempsey
and Millan created a web-based performance/media piece featuring a mock
freedom-fighting liberation force dedicated to rampant thoughtfulness,
criticism, and satire. The visual vocabulary of Consideration Liberation Army was inspired by the iconography of American radicals of the 1960s. Many groups of that era
combined flamboyance, militancy, and eloquence to push democratic and
social reform forward (i.e., The Weather Underground, Students for a
Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, etc.). The histories of these
radical movements are rife with heartbreak, failures of judgment, foolish
extremes, and bloody tragedy. They are also brimming with brilliant
ideologies, inspiring orators, profound collective action, great
cultural/artistic achievements, and high style. 

Not unlike many of these radicals, Dempsey and Millan were moved by an
urgent need to cut through the non-stop noise of commercial interests,
political and corporate spin, media saturation and fear mongering.
Consideration Liberation Army invaded public spaces/sites that are
overwhelmed with status quo cultural and commercial content, to insert
signs, symbols, tracts, and sounds designed to provoke thoughtfulness,
care, and action. 

The project opened  in Winnipeg on July 1, 2007, and
continued until September, resulting in The Summer of Thought. The
artistic/political “cell” gained recognition, momentum and legitimacy
through a website featuring manifestos, video communiqués, “audio
bombs”, stencil downloads, and a revolutionary walking tour
(considerationliberation.ca). Stickers, buttons, and graffiti marked public
spaces. Using diverse sites throughout the community, such as the local
anarchist bookstore and coffeehouse, artist run venues, and downtown
locations, Consideration Liberation Army created an environment of
dialogue, and a stage for surprise, delight, and thoughtfulness.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"In this performance, the world-weary mother of God proffers wry advice and sage warnings from behind her stained glass dress. Fashioned like a two-dimensional carnival cutout with holes for her hands and head, the dress is a colorful and explicit rendering of the Virgin Mary’s familiar garment, with a sheer panel of clear glass to reveal the root of the Madonna’s fame: her 2000 year-old hymen. In each of her visitations, Mary comments on love, service, and the men in her life.

This piece is part of The Dress Series (1989-1996), a group of performances that explore the dress as the female ceremonial costume and icon of femininity. In these pieces, cloth is replaced by unlikely materials, creating juxtaposition, new meanings and upending expectations. All costumes fabricated by Dempsey and Millan.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMARY]Grocery Store was a site-specific performance installation
developed by The Co-Op Collective: Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan, jake
moore and Zab. For three weeks in August 2002, the store provided food and food
for thought in downtown Winnipeg’s Ace Art Gallery. The installation (a
functioning food store staffed by Dempsey and Millan) sold over $5000 worth
of food, and essential provisions unavailable in Winnipeg’s core. Radio
ads, a leaflet advertising sale prices, and a mail-in-coupon campaign to
the mayor requesting real-life downtown services expanded the discussion
about the direction of urban revitalization in our city.
[BIOCollaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among
Canada’s best-known performance artists. They were catapulted into the
international spotlight in their 20s with the performance and film We’re
Talking Vulva. Since then, their live work and videos have been exhibited
in diverse venues as far-ranging as women's centers in Sri Lanka to the
Museum of Modern Art in New York City. This Winnipeg-based duo has created
installations (such as Archaeology and You for the Royal Ontario Museum),
public art pieces (such as One Gay City, the subject of a Manitoba Human
Rights Commission challenge) and books (such as Bedtime Stories for the
Edge of the World, Arbeiter Ring Press). To most, however, they are known
simply as the Lesbian Rangers of Lesbian National Parks and Services. Their
humorous, feminist and provocative work has been acclaimed as “one of the
high-points of contemporary Canadian artistic production” (Border
Crossings Magazine). Dempsey and Millan are the recipients of many awards,
most proudly the Canadian Museums Association Award for Outstanding
Publication and the Manitoba Arts Council Special Prize for Innovation and
Excellence.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Growing Up Suites I and II explore the lesbian body as a site of
both pleasure and difference. Lesbianism, defined by desire for other
women, creates the label “homosexual.” At the same time, fear of
so-called social deviance is played out on queer individuals in a variety
of subtle and not-so-subtle ways, from isolation to censorship to violence.
 

“Ten pages of lingerie that resembled architecture, covered in buckles
and zippers and snaps! Industrial strength underwear concealing body parts
I did not have, body parts so powerful they needed hardware to keep them in
place.”

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This performance is a testament to collective North American
history, the myths that history has spawned, and the pointed ways in which
certain groups of people are, and are not, represented. It is also a
metaphorical tale about the oppressive nature of conformity, and the
creative, heroic ways that people have circumvented it. Out of a
male-dominant and racist Lone Ranger and Tonto legend, the performance
creates an alternative narrative of other, less-often-heard, realities. The
piece uses the convention of storytelling to question the role of stories
in creating the dominant culture’s vision of North America, and the
veracity of the stories themselves. Performed with a live musical score by
Diane Kooch (bass). 
“What happens when the Lone Ranger takes off the mask? When the fabric
slips and rips and shifts? What happens when the mask falls, leaving her
naked between the bridge and the brow?”
This piece is part of Tales for A New World, a series of performances that
takes as their inspiration the stories that form North American mythology:
yarns and fables belonging to cowboys, Indians, voyageurs, spinsters, and
big city Horatio Algers. These are tales which have been glamourized by
popular culture, and which exist in iconic proportions. Yet they are
relatively young, pliable stories, no more than 200 years old. Dempsey and
Millan bend them so they reflect a different perspective. By imposing an
ironic lesbian and feminist reading/retelling upon these tales, they
illuminate our history and our present, and create alternative archetypes
that propose new “new worlds.”

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Lift is a performance situated in the smallest of spaces: an
elevator. The doors open to the iconic elevator operator dressed in a red
pillbox hat and uniform circa 1940. She holds doors and announces floors,
conducting passengers up and down a functioning office tower. Also present
is an anonymous everywoman, a contemporary office worker who, once the
doors close, begins to tell her fellow passengers a story. Her 20-minute
looping story-cycle interrupts the normal flow of the 9-to-5 office with a
fairy tale about a modern woman’s descent into a mysterious underworld.
The gothic fable explores the pliable nature of time, and the ways in which
our perception of time affects our actions, inactions and relationships.

The performance takes place in an actual office building over an entire
business day or week. The riders/audience generally only experience
excerpts from the tale during short journeys. Sometimes they choose to ride
to extra floors. Sometimes they swap details with their fellow workers over
the water cooler. The full story is accumulated as the day or week
progresses.[BIO]Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan
are among Canada’s best-known performance artists. They were catapulted
into the international spotlight in their 20s with the performance and film

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This performance is one of Dempsey and Millan’s “Archetype
Performances” in which familiar characters examine the lessons and images
from the stories, myths and codes that have shaped us. Dempsey and Millan
subvert these icons' accepted meanings and retell their tales from a
contemporary female perspective. This project began as a short performance
piece in which the Medusa icon was reconceived as a successful, Margaret
Thatcher-era businesswoman. It then evolved into a longer, multi-media
performance exploring modern female icons and questions of power (“Who
has power? Do I have power? Where can I get some?”). [BIO]Collaborators
since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known
performance artists. They were catapulted into the international spotlight
in their 20s with the performance and film We’re Talking Vulva. Since
then, their live work and videos have been exhibited in diverse venues as

New York City. This Winnipeg-based duo has created installations (such as

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"This gallery piece inhabits the space in a non-theatrical way, acting as living sculpture or imitation of “real-world” commercial site. At Scentbar, clients are asked a variety of questions about their memories. Using the results of these questions, a technician then creates an individualized formula to reflect the clients’ anxieties and desires. The perfumes are blended from an odor palette that includes scents such as junk food, light industry, rental car and grandma’s purse. Unlike mass-produced consumer products, Scentbar delivers truly one-of-a-kind fragrances in just 15 minutes."[BIO]"Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known performance artists.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]""We're Talking Vulva publicly talks about many of the private things vulvas do. The live performance was reconceived by Dempsey and Millan, and became a film in 1990. Created as a mock music video, it upends expectations by replacing the conventional brooding, straight, white, male star with a giant vulva. She goes about her day (shopping, banking, working at a construction site), embodying the most basic part of her identity.

Since its inception, this piece has created an array of controversy. When the film was released in 1990, a provincial Member of Parliament suggested that an X rating be created in Manitoba to ensure children would never see it. The National Film Board of Canada, which funded the film, received threatening phone calls. Because of its inclusion in Hallwalls Centre for Contemporary Art’s support material in 1998, the US National Endowment for the Arts suspended all funding to Hallwalls for one year. After screening the film to high school students at University of Winnipeg in 2001, a parent complained, resulting in a media firestorm locally known as “Veggiegate” (Dempsey and Millan were erroneously accused of teaching teenage girls how to masturbate with vegetables).

Nonetheless, this piece has played globally to an estimated audience of over one million viewers, and has been aired on the CBC in Canada and Canal+ in Europe. The performance represented Canada at the 3rd Istanbul Bienali in 1992 and is held in the National Gallery of Canada’s collection."[BIO]"Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known performance artists. They were catapulted into the international spotlight in their 20s with the performance and film We’re Talking Vulva.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"The Thin Skin of Normal most prominently features an evening gown, positioned as the symbol for the sophisticated, “proper” lady. However, this particular gown is created out of Saran Wrap, pierced with outward pointing 4"" roofing nails. The costume references “The Total Woman”, a book which advised women of the seventies that, to keep their marriages alive, they should greet their husbands, arriving home from a hard day's work, at the door, wearing only cling wrap. The long nails rupture both this concept and the surface of the garment, and inspire the performance text that angrily and ironically confronts the absurdity of gender role definitions.

This piece is part of The Dress Series (1989-1996), a group of performances that explore the dress as the female ceremonial costume and icon of femininity. In these pieces, cloth is replaced by unlikely materials, creating juxtaposition, new meanings and upending expectations. All costumes fabricated by Dempsey and Millan.

“2000 years of patriarchy haven’t dampened my sense of style. When I get dressed in the morning, I’m doing more than covering a little original sin.”"[bio]"Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known performance artists. They were catapulted into the international spotlight in their 20s with the performance and film We’re Talking Vulva. Since then, their live work and videos have been exhibited in diverse venues as far-ranging as women's centers in Sri Lanka to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. This Winnipeg-based duo has created installations (such as Archaeology and You for the Royal Ontario Museum), public art pieces (such as One Gay City, the subject of a Manitoba Human Rights Commission challenge) and books (such as Bedtime Stories for the Edge of the World, Arbeiter Ring Press). To most, however, they are known simply as the Lesbian Rangers of Lesbian National Parks and Services. Their humorous, feminist and provocative work has been acclaimed as “one of the high-points of contemporary Canadian artistic production” (Border Crossings Magazine). Dempsey and Millan are the recipients of many awards, most proudly the Canadian Museums Association Award for Outstanding Publication and the Manitoba Arts Council Special Prize for Innovation and Excellence."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]""The central visual element in Object-Subject Desire is a large ball gown, constructed of crisp white paper, reminiscent of a debutante gown. Translucent and stiff, fragile yet unyielding, the dress rustles noisily as Dempsey moves and speaks.

Within this costume the many complexities of desire are discussed, including the many ways desire can be negated. The purity and innocence of the dress, the open expression of ""wanting"", and the sweetness of delivery together create an assumption that the object of affection discussed is the traditional heterosexual partner. However, these cultural assumptions are confronted during the last section of the piece, as Dempsey finally, explicitly, reveals the carnality of her desire for another woman.

“I want you, to want me. I want you to want me, even though I don't really want you. I don't want you at all, but I want everyone else to.

All I want is your want.”[BIO]"Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known performance artists.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Pilot Lorri Millan and Flight Attendant Shawna Dempsey board
passengers for a performance aboard a vintage Vickers Viscount passenger
jet. The metaphysical journey charts the entwined fates of a pair of
newlyweds, a precocious child, a war veteran and a hijacker. However, it is
the audience who are the true passengers, travelling through time and space
as Dempsey and Millan spin a 1970s tale laced with disco, salted peanuts
and transcendence. 

“This is 1979. The flight attendant is modern. She is a product of the
sexual revolution and women’s lib. She has a job and her own apartment.
She’s been to discos in big cities. Whenever she looks up into the night
sky, she scans for UFOs. This is 1979, when airlines simply take hijackers
where they want to go. No security checks, no searches, no air marshals.
Every international pilot is issued a map of Havana’s airport. It is that
common. This is 1979, when everything seems possible because everything is
impossible. The red button, the Cold War, nuclear war, nuclear winter…
time is ticking! Nothing inspires living like imminent death.”"[BIO]Collaborators
since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known
performance artists. They were catapulted into the international spotlight
in their 20s with the performance and film We’re Talking Vulva. Since

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Lesbian National Parks and Services was founded in 1997 to insert
a lesbian presence into the landscape. In full uniform as Lesbian Rangers,
Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan patrol parklands, challenging the general
public’s ideas of tourism, recreation, and the “natural” environment.
Equipped with informative brochures and well-researched knowledge, they are
a visible homosexual presence in spaces where concepts of history and
biology exclude all but a very few. The Rangers are in near constant demand
and have performed “tours-of-duty” across Canada and abroad including
the Sydney Gay/Lesbian Mardi Gras (Australia) and Michigan Womyn’s Music
Festival (USA) in all manner of terrain from parks to city streets to
university halls. They have also written brochures and books, created
postcards and videos, informing and recruiting since 1997. The Rangers’
work is ongoing. “Do unto lesbians as you would have lesbians do unto
you.”" [BIO]Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"In this performance, the bride wears an iconic wedding gown, the
classic raiment of femininity, virginity, and promise. However, the
gown’s intended meaning is transformed by its construction, from veil to
train, of clear vinyl. The material encases the bride, suggesting more
clinical references to body bags and scientific specimens, or commodities
bagged and displayed for purchase. Love and fashion, desire and denial are
performed within the gown’s unforgiving folds. This piece is part of The
Dress Series (1989-1996), a group of performances that explore the dress as
the female ceremonial costume and icon of femininity. In these pieces,
cloth is replaced by unlikely materials, creating juxtaposition, new
meanings and upending expectations. All costumes fabricated by Dempsey and
Millan. “You have gone shopping with a friend, your sister or even your
own mother, and been told, ‘It's perfect. It's you. It's a knockout,’
only to find out later that it's a funeral, not a wedding. It's July, not
December. You’re a nurse, not an aviator.”" [BIO]Collaborators since
1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are among Canada’s best-known
performance artists. They were catapulted into the international spotlight
in their 20s with the performance and film We’re Talking Vulva. Since
then, their live work and videos have been exhibited in diverse venues as
far-ranging as women's centers in Sri Lanka to the Museum of Modern Art in
New York City. This Winnipeg-based duo has created installations (such as
Archaeology and You for the Royal Ontario Museum), public art pieces (such
as One Gay City, the subject of a Manitoba Human Rights Commission
challenge) and books (such as Bedtime Stories for the Edge of the World,
Arbeiter Ring Press). To most, however, they are known simply as the
Lesbian Rangers of Lesbian National Parks and Services. Their humorous,
feminist and provocative work has been acclaimed as “one of the
high-points of contemporary Canadian artistic production” (Border
Crossings Magazine). Dempsey and Millan are the recipients of many awards,
most proudly the Canadian Museums Association Award for Outstanding
Publication and the Manitoba Arts Council Special Prize for Innovation and
Excellence.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"The ways in which news media has transformed our relationship to
language and activism is explored through a first-person narrative into
which the symbols of terrorism literally drop from the ceiling. It is
estimated that within the next two centuries, forty percent of the
world’s extant languages will no longer be contemporary modes of thought
or expression. At the same time, “dominant” languages are devolving
into the brevity of advertising and journalism. Sentence length is
shrinking, and descriptives are seen as superfluous. With this
de-languagification, concepts as well as cultures are being lost. This
performance explores the irony of the current age where we have the means
to dialogue and advocate locally, nationally and globally, yet we are
losing the very language with which we communicate. “The following
performance contains no nudity, violence or coarse language. No animals
were harmed in the creation of this piece, and no meat will be prepared or
eaten on stage. Be forewarned that there will be no strobe lights,
fireworks or pyrotechnics of any kind, and no gunshots will be fired. What
you are about to see will bore children, the elderly, and those of you
in-between. Time will crawl by and you will curse the friend who brought
you here. You will consider asking for your money back, but that would
require one-on-one interaction with the performer and then you might never
get out of here (smile). No, tonight’s spectacle will in no way be
spectacular. In fact the spectacular will be studiously avoided, so this
won’t be much of a spectacle at all.”"[BIO]Collaborators since 1989,

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"This performance posits rage as a justifiable, logical, and
emotional response to contemporary world events. There are two components
to this work, a printed text given to the audience to be read at their
leisure, and a performance examining a woman’s anger. The written
narrative tells the story of the childhood of Victorian murderess, Lizzie
Borden, who was accused of killing her parents. In contrast to the print
work’s 19th century poetic style, the live performance tells a tale of
present-day kleptomania, grooming, and the rush to war. In an irony-laden
tirade, Dempsey explains why she steals women’s magazines.

This piece is part of Tales for A New World, a series of performances that
takes as their inspiration the stories that form North American mythology:
yarns and fables belonging to cowboys, Indians, voyageurs, spinsters, and
big city Horatio Algers. These are tales that have been glamorized by
popular culture and exist in iconic proportions. Yet they are relatively
young, pliable stories, no more than 200 years old. Dempsey and Millan bend
them so they reflect a different perspective. By imposing an ironic lesbian
and feminist reading/retelling upon these tales, they illuminate our
history and our present, and create alternative archetypes that propose new
“new worlds.”

“This is not a weapon. This is not an axe. This is a hatchet. A smaller,
scaled down, more feminine, less effectual version. Not a tool, an
accessory! And accessories create interest. But be careful. If you create
too much interest, it just clutters the look.”"[BIO]Collaborators since

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"What does a feminist superhero look like? Can she leap tall
buildings in a single bound? Bend steel with her bare hands? What is her
name? And does anyone remember it? In Unruly, the eponymously named
superhero fights the worlds villains and ills with poetic quotations
inspiring awe and self-reflection. Whether confounding a would-be thief or
frightening attackers with Maya Angelou's words on courage, Unruly is an
aging hero who upends notions of heroism and wrestles the idea of ""super""
to the ground. 

“I pull poetry out of my ass. I know that sounds funny, but that's the
thing about super powers. They all sound weird until they're needed.
Anyway, does everything have to have a purpose? Is beauty not enough? Is
truth not the point? Words flowing from my butt that help us make sense of
ourselves—that's pretty darn super. Might that not someday save the
world?"""[BIO]Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"In this performance, it is the year 3000 and all languages have
disappeared from Earth, leaving only Universal Abbreviated American, a
complex system of gestures, as the only means of communication. The last
remaining speaker of Old English itemizes the reasons for the demise of
global communication. In short: Where did language go? The professor gives
an illustrated slide lecture that no one else can hear, in an archaic
tongue she has taught herself from videos of ""Dynasty"" and ""The Kathy
and Regis Show."" However, in the tradition of utopic novels, such as
Looking Back and Looking Back 2000 (from which the performance takes its
name), not all is as bleak as it seems. Nostalgia is replacing cynicism,
and people still are still hoping to find love and genuine connection.
(Sound of a rocket launch.) “That is the sound inside each of us when we
want to run away. Four billion people dreaming of packing a space suitcase
and heading for the door. Fearing there’s nowhere left to go, and hoping
there’s some reason to stay. Hoping, that as we reach the threshold,
someone will touch our sleeve and say, “Please don’t go. Please.’”

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Tracie Morris’ Afrofem (1995) critiques stereotypical
representations of black women in the media. In this work-in-progress
performance, Morris portrays the multi-faceted character Deetra who
embodies different black women archetypes—the gangsta bitch, little
hottie, creole mama, mammy, and welfare queen. She performs spoken-word
poetry to jazz-funk and forms a bond of sisterhood with the character
played by Suzanne Y. Jones. Throughout, Morris draws from elements of
B-girl culture and Blaxploitation film—a genre that emerged in the 1970s
whose use of well-known black stereotypes resulted in complicated and often
contested portrayals of black characters. She flips the script on such
historical characterizations by critiquing the hypersexualization of black
women's bodies while simultaneousy refusing to conform to respectability
politics. In doing so, Morris embodies black female empowerment while
shattering racist stereotypes perpetuated by white supremacy. [BIO]"Tracie
Morris is Coordinator of the Performance and Performance Studies MFA
program at Pratt Institute. Morris is a poet who also works as a scholar,
writer, vocalist, bandleader, and performer. Her sound installations have
been presented at the Museum of Modern Art, The Kitchen, Whitney Museum of
American Art, Drawing Center, Ronald Feldman Fine Arts Gallery,
Philadelphia Museum of Art, Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, and
Thomas Hirschhorn’s Gramsci Monument presented by Dia Art Foundation.
Morris has received awards, fellowships, and grants for poetry and
performance from NYFA, Asian Cultural Council, Franklin Furnace, and
Creative Capital. Her publications include Intermission (Soft Skull Press,
1998); Rhyme Scheme (Zasterle Press, 2012); handholding: 5 kinds (Kore
Press 2016); and Best American Experimental Writing (co-edited with Charles
Bernstein, Wesleyan University Press, 2017). Morris holds an MFA in Poetry
from Hunter College and a PhD in Performance Studies from New York
University. www.traciemorris.com"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Amber Hawk Swanson’s Doll Closet (2014) explores the closet as a
site of secrecy for queer sexuality and doll ownership. Live streamed
online for one week, the durational performance is a collaboration between
Hawk Swanson and Jesse—both of whom are active members of the doll
community. Throughout the performance, Hawk Swanson constructs a replica of
the hidden closet where Jesse secretly kept his RealDoll Heather for
fifteen years. Jesse provides Hawk Swanson with instructions on how to
build the closet and also discloses intimate details about his relationship
with Heather (whose body parts are present as objects in the performance to
bear witness to the construction). Here, Hawk Swanson makes the private
accessible to the public by creating a space for the doll community to
share “closeted” desires, fantasies, and sexualities without breaking
anonymity. The metaphor of the closet becomes a rendered site that asks
what kinds of relationships can flourish in secrecy? Through the process of
replicating Heather’s closet, Hawk Swanson constructs a queer body
politic that confronts binary notions of what constitutes intimacy,
sexuality, and artificiality.[BIO]"Amber Hawk Swanson is a video and
performance artist based in New York City. Hawk Swanson's work explores how
the psychological debt of love animates us in a social-emotional economy.
She has exhibited at Palais de Tokyo (Paris, France); Denny Gallery (New
York, NY); and Locust Projects (Miami, FL), among other international art

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Cassils transgresses social gender constructions in Hard Times
(2010). Throughout the performance, Cassils alludes to Tiresias—a blind
prophet in Greek mythology who mediates between male/female, blind/seeing,
and present/future. Cassils poses on a scaffold in a coral bikini, blonde
wig, and prosthetic mask that blinds their vision while the audience gazes
at their body. They perform literal and figurative gestures that subvert
iconography in classic Western sculpture and portraiture. Cassils invokes
affect through body language that works to liberate gender binaries and
standards of beauty. Ultimately, Cassils employs a trans temporality to
create an image that politically challenges the superficial.[BIO]"Performance
artist Cassils uses the body as sculpture to deconstruct societal norms. By
using a queer lens to examine physical training, kinesiology, and sports
science, Cassils manipulates the body into a shape that defies the gender
binary. Cassils performs trans identity not as transitioning from one sex
to another, but as a continual process of becoming. It is with sweat,
blood, and sinew that Cassils constructs a visual critique and discourse
around physical and gender ideologies and histories. Drawing on body art,
feminism, gay male aesthetics, conceptualism, and Hollywood cinema, Cassils
creates a visual language that is emotionally striking and conceptually
incisive. ww.heathercassils.com"

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Dread Scott’s performance intervention Money to Burn (2010)
challenges the politics of capitalism. Performed on Wall Street in New York
City, Scott repeatedly sings the phrase “Money to burn” while lighting
currency on fire. The currency Scott burns includes his personal money,
grant money awarded by Franklin Furnace, and donated money from
pedestrians. His gesture of burning money—an action that is considered a
crime in the United States under Title 18, Section 333—illuminates the
epidemic of income inequality and signals for an economic system not based
on profit. It is important to note that the currency Scott burns is not
exchanged for any goods or services. Rather, the pyre of dollar bill ashes
that form throughout the intervention becomes a site for the public to
imagine an economy outside of capital gain.[BIO]"Dread Scott makes
revolutionary art to propel history forward. Scott works in a range of
media including performance, installation, photography, screen-printing,
and video. His artwork illuminates the oppressive structures forged by
society and challenges the audience to envision a world where justice
prevails. Scott has exhibited at Cristin Tierney Gallery, MoMA PS1, Whitney
Museum of American Art, Winkleman Gallery, Walker Art Center, Contemporary
Arts Museum Houston, and Pori Art Museum. He has  presented Dread Scott:
Welcome to America (2008) at the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan
Arts, and Dread Scott: Decision (2012) at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as
part of the Next Wave Festival. Scott’s artwork is included in
collections at the  New Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Akron
Art Museum. His public sculptures are installed at Logan Square in
Philadelphia and Franconia Sculpture Park in Minnesota. He has received
grants from Creative Capital Foundation, Franklin Furance, and
Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Scott has also been awarded fellowships for his
work from the New York Foundation for the Arts. He has been an
Artist-in-Residence at OMI International Arts Center and Lower Manhattan
Cultural Council. www.dreadscott.net"

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Julie Tolentino and cast explore the body politics of movement in
The Bottom Project (2000). Tolentino uses the collective body in motion as
an act of resistance against the backdrop of the AIDS pandemic. The
performers engage the meaning of the word “bottom” as a precarious
space through a non-linear narrative that encompasses movement, visuals,
and sound. As evidenced in the performance, the bottom is a metaphorical
space of exploration, a space of radical unbecoming, and a space free of
social hierarchies. Furthermore, Tolentino employs a queer mestiza lens by
working with a diverse group of bodies on stage. She draws from her
activist work in ACT UP New York and from managing the sex-positive venue
the Clit Club to create a radical choreographic approach to movement.
Tolentino’s approach can be seen as a movement intervention calling for a
new set of body politics in the performance scene for that time. The
performers collectively embody these politics through a fluid configuration
of race, gender, and sexuality. Together, Tolentino and cast create a space
to build a coalition across communities while also providing a foundation
to envision new political imaginaries for queer ways of being in the
world.[BIO]"Julie Tolentino is a performance artist, dancer/choreographer,
and visual artist. Her art explores the intersections of queer sexual
subcultures, Eastern healing practices, and HIV/AIDS cultural activism.
Tolentino’s solo and collaborative work has been presented at Invisible
Exports, The Kitchen, New Museum, Participant Inc., Performa, San
Francisco Art Institute, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Commonwealth &
Council, The Broad, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, Museum of
Contemporary Art, Los Angles, and Wexner Center, among other venues. She
has worked on projects with Ron Athey, Candidate, Robert Crouch, Stosh
Fila, Gran Fury, Diamanda Galás, Gerard & Kelly, Stanley Love,
Lovett/Codagnone, Catherine Opie, David Rousseve, Madonna, Mark So, and
Meg Stuart. Tolentino was a founding member of  ACT UP New York's House of
Color Video Collective and the legendary Clit Club—a lesbian nightclub in
New York City that promoted safe-sex and existed as an intergenerational,
multi-racial, and mixed class venue for women. She co-wrote the Lesbian
AIDS Project's Women's Safer Sex Handbook, co-edited the TDR
""Provocations"" section, and served as editor of Guard Your Daughters:
Clit Club 1990-2002. Tolentino resides in New York City and Joshua Tree,
where she created a solar-powered live/work residency called FERAL House
and Studio. www.julietolentino.com"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Lawrence Graham-Brown confronts religion, sexuality, and
blackness in Rites of Passage/Sacred Spaces (2012). Performed as a
site-specific work at Judson Memorial Church, Graham-Brown and company
engage in ritualistic acts that draw from Afro-Caribbean folklore. The
performers use fetish objects and various aromas in the tradition of
Obeah—magic, sorcery, and religious practices developed by West Africans
enslaved in the Caribbean to ward off misfortune or to cause harm to
another—while performing homoerotic gestures. In this rite of passage,
the gay black male body becomes both a site of worship and a symbol of
resurrection. This queer form of salvation seeks to reverse oppressive
doctrines that label homosexuality a sin. Instead, the power of redemption
is displaced and reclaimed. These acts work to combat and dispel homophobic
ideals in religion, especially in Graham-Brown’s native Jamaica, where
Christianity is used to justify the killing and oppression of L.G.B.T.Q.
people. 
"[BIO]"Lawrence Graham-Brown is a cross-disciplinary artist working in
performance, sculpture, painting, and media. As an openly gay
Jamaican-American man, Graham-Brown's art practice works to combat
homophobia and racism across geographical contexts. He uses his body as
canvas to dispel the stigma that queer, intersexed, transgender,
indigenous, and people of color routinely face. His artwork has been
presented at the Queens Museum; El Museo del Barrio; Leslie Lohman Museum
of Gay and Lesbian Art; Aljira, A Center for Contemporary Arts; Institute
of Jamaica; National Gallery of Jamaica; Galeria Homero Massena; Royal West
of England Academy; Arnolfini Centre for Contemporary Arts; Galerie Lutz
Rohs; and Shanghai Biennial, among other international art venues.
Graham-Brown's work has been written about in the New York Times,
Huffington Post, Jamaica Gleaner, Art Recognition Culture (ARC) Magazine,
Caribbean Art World (CAW) Magazine, and THE ARCHIVE journal of the
Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art."

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"M. Lamar examines the sexual politics surrounding the
surveillance of the black male body in Surveillance Punishment and The
Black Psyche (2013). Set in the American South, Lamar portrays a death row
prisoner who sings about the historical legacy of black men being watched
by white overseers. Performed in the tradition of the spiritual, the song's
narrative centers around a slave condemned to death for killing his master
whom he loved. Throughout this plantation fantasy, the politics of
interracial and same-sex desire are explored from a black man’s point of
view. As evidenced in the lyric “With his touch I felt free,”
discipline becomes a form of pleasure rather than punishment. Here, Lamar
reverses the power dynamic of the white male overseer’s gaze—the black
slave associates his master’s watch with affection rather than
persecution. As the song ends, the prisoner alludes to the prison-industrial
complex as a form of modern day slavery, while connecting the role police
surveillance plays in enforcing such oppression. Ultimately, blackness is
always under surveillance and subjected to punishment by white
supremacy."[BIO]"M. Lamar is a composer working in music, performance,
video, sculpture, and installation. Drawing heavily from the Negro
spiritual, Lamar uses his operatic voice and piano playing to comment on
the politics of blackness.  He combines western classical music and
dissonant black metal to create narratives of radical becomings.  Lamar has
presented work at the New Museum, MoMA PS1, Participant Inc., The Kitchen,
PS122, among other international art venues. Lamar has received grants from
Franklin Furnace (2013–14), Harpo Foundation (2014-2015), Rema Hort Mann
Foundation (2015), and Material Vodka (2016). He is the recipient of the
New York Foundation of the Arts Fellowship in Music and Sound (2016). Lamar
holds a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute and attended the Yale
School of Art sculpture program before dropping out to pursue music. He
continues to study classical and bel canto technique with Ira Siff while
performing his work across the world. www.mlamar.com"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Rashaad Newsome explores social-political issues surrounding
black vernacular in Shade Compositions (2009). Working with a chorus of
black women, Newsome records, edits, and loops their gestures live by using
a hacked Nintendo Wii game controller. The different racial tones of
blackness expressed in the sound score derive from cultural stereotypes
associated with the black female body. Newsome and the chorus remix
representations constructed by mainstream media and popular culture.
Essentially, they throw back the “shade”—a term historically amongst
queer Black and Latino men and straight Black women, which has recently
seen a resurgence in "mainstream" culture—as a gesture to critique
negative perceptions of black women. In the process of doing so, the
performers create a sound and image that works to uplift and affirm black
women's identities and to reclaim black vernacular."[BIO]"Rashaad Newsome
is a visual artist working in collage, video, sculpture, music, and
performance. His art practice examines how images in media and popular
culture convey distorted notions of power. Newsome has exhibited and
performed in the following art venues: Brooklyn Museum, MoMA PS1, Whitney
Museum of American Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, New Orleans
Museum of Art, Centre Georges Pompidou, Garage Museum of Contemporary Art,
and Museum Start Gallery Artothek. He participated in the Whitney Biennial
at the Whitney Museum in 2010 and Greater New York at MoMA PS1 in 2011.
Newsome has received awards and grants from Franklin Furnace, Harvestworks,
L' Entreprise Culturelle, BCAT/BRIC Rotunda Gallery, and Location One. His
artwork is part of the public collections at the Brooklyn Museum, Whitney
Museum of American Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and New Britain

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Zackary Drucker and Mother Flawless Sabrina investigate the
erasure of transgender history in At Least You Know You Exist (2011). In
this excerpt, Drucker engages in a trans-generational dialogue with Mother
Flawless Sabrina inside of her New York City apartment—a salon for queers
and artists since 1968. The acts the artists perform can be view as
embodied repertoires that transmit memory, identity, and culture across
time and space. They also reflect how transgender history has largely been
excluded from archives and how such history has mainly been passed down
from one generation to the next through orality. Furthermore, Drucker and
Sabrina use film to record their artistic relationship through a trans
lens, as both creators and subjects of the work. The artists create a new
vision for transgender performativity and construct a historical narrative
on their own terms. This is most evident when Drucker proclaims to Mother
Flawless Sabrina at the end of the excerpt: “Because of you, I know that
I exist.” Ultimately, the film becomes a document of transgender history
for future generations to access."[BIO]"Zackary Drucker is a visual artist
and cultural producer based in Los Angeles. Drucker’s work examines
perceptions of gender and sexuality through a transgender lens. Her art has
been performed and exhibited at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Hammer Museum,
Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
Venice Biennale–Swiss Off-Site Pavilion, Whitney Museum of American Art,
and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, among other venues. Drucker is an
Emmy-nominated Producer for the docu-series This Is Me (2015), as well as a
Co-Producer on the Golden Globe and Emmy-winning television series
Transparent (2014-). She is a cast member on the E! docu-series I Am Cait
(2015). Drucker is represented by Luis De Jesus Los Angeles.

Mother Flawless Sabrina (Jack Doroshow) is a legendary drag queen and an
icon of queer underground culture. Sabrina directed the drag beauty pageant
The Nationals in the United States from 1958-1968. She stared in the
documentary The Queen (1968), and worked as a consultant on the films
Midnight Cowboy (1969), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), and Myra
Breckinridge (1970).  In later years, Sabrina became involved in politics
advocating for gay marriage and working with Hilary Clinton on transgender
issues. She is an active member of the queer community and a resource for
transgender people in the arts. Sarbina, along with Zackary Drucker and
Diana Tourjee, founded the Flawless Sabrina Archive in 2014 to preserve and
make accessible the rich legacy of her lifework. www.flawless-sabrina.com"

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Co-founded by Peter Gabriel in England in 1982, WOMAD — World of
Music, Art and Dance — became a vehicle for introducing “World Music”
to western audiences. This 1988 festival at Toronto’s Harbourfront Centre
was the first WOMAD festival to take place in North America and
foregrounded Toronto’s strong multicultural community with performances
from local artists of Caribbean, African, Asian and Native Canadian
descent. Performing tracks from her Juno Award winning Reggae/Calypso
albums, Revolutionary Tea Party (1986) and Conditions Critical (1988),
Lillian Allen powerfully demonstrates the political power of stylistic
fusion within a diasporic setting. With “Rub a Dub Style Inna Regent
Park” Allen integrates Jamaican English with specific Toronto geography
and contemporary urban influences to illustrate how diasporic spaces both
call for and produce subversive new musical and textual styles. Similarly,
with “I Fight Back” Allen enacts a code-switching style that fights the
imposition of Standard English as an indicator of hierarchical knowledge
structures and situates Jamaican English as linguistically displaced and
yet empowered. And, as always, Allen brings to the highly politicized genre
of dub poetry her woman-identified perspective with performances of
“Birth Poem,” “Nelly Belly Swelly,” and “Sister Hold
On”—works that use sound and music as visceral mediums to break taboos
about women’s lived experiences. This documentation includes an
introduction by Clifton Joseph, and the following reggae dub poetry pieces:
“I Fight Back,” “Birth Poem,” “Nellie Belly Swelly,” “Natural
Rights,” “Sister Hold On,” “Rub-a-Dub Style inna Regent Park,”
“Conditions Critical," and “The Subversives.”[BIO]Lillian Allen is
recognized as a key originator and a leading exponent of dub poetry—a
highly politicized form of poetry that is sometimes set to music and is
considered a literary godmother of rap, hip-hop and spoken word poetry.
Originally from Spanish Town, Jamaica, Allen has been an influential figure
on the global cultural landscape for over four decades. She is credited
with opening up the form of dub poetry to enlist and engage feminist
content and sensibilities. Her albums Revolutionary Tea Party and
Conditions Critical won Juno awards in 1986 and 1988 respectively.
Allen’s multi-disciplinary and experimental creativity extends across
many genres. In addition to being an award-winning and internationally
renowned poet and writer of short stories and plays, Allen was the
instigator, co-producer and host of WORDBEAT, CBC's national radio show on
poetry and the spoken word; she is featured in the films Revolution from de
Beat (1995); Unnatural Causes (1989); Rhythm and Hardtimes (1998); and
co-produced/co-directed Blak … Wi Blakk’ (1994), a documentary film on
Jamaican dub poet Mutabaruka which premiered at the Toronto International
Film Festival. She is a professor of creative writing at Ontario College of
Art and Design University (OCADU). www.lillianallen.ca

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Lillian Allen is no stranger to border crossing. Born in Spanish
Town, Jamaica, Allen moved to New York City in 1968 before settling in
Canada in the early 1970s. But as this compilation of performances at two
disparate locations—the Canadian League of Poets Benefit (1990) and the
15th Michigan Womyn's Music Festival (1990)—illustrates, Allen’s border
crossings also transcend institutional, political, and aesthetic
enclosures. Through both form and content, Allen’s dub poetry speaks a
language of political intersectionality. Often credited with opening up the
dub form to feminist content and sensibilities, Allen has also been at the
forefront of the struggle to have dub poetry recognized as a literary form.
Just six year’s prior to her reading at the Canadian League of Poets,
Allen and fellow dub poets Clifton Joseph and Devon Haughton were refused
membership in the League on the grounds that they were performers rather
than poets. The League’s refusal of membership exposes the ways in which
normative assumptions about poetry and literature construct borders of
inclusion and exclusion based in hierarchical norms of class, culture, and
race. Notably, in 1992, the League awarded Allen the Foremother of Canadian
Poetry prize. The documentation of performances at the Canadian League of
Poets Benefit includes readings of the poems "Dark Winds" and "Jazz Poem,"
while the documentation of the 15th Michigan Womyn's Festival includes the
Reggae Dub Poetry pieces (with musical backup) "Fine Mary," "Nellie Belly
Swelly," and "Birth Poem." [BIO]Lillian Allen is recognized as a key
originator and a leading exponent of dub poetry—a highly politicized form
of poetry that is sometimes set to music and is considered a literary
godmother of rap, hip-hop and spoken word poetry. Originally from Spanish
Town, Jamaica, Allen has been an influential figure on the global cultural
landscape for over four decades. She is credited with opening up the form

    [SUMMARY]"As a grassroots artist, cultural activist, and scholar, Lillian
Allen’s work is used across the educational spectrum from kindergarten to
postgraduate studies. With her dub poetry album, Nothing But a Hero, and
children’s book, Why Me?, Allen provides children with engaging and
accessible tools for political analysis. Nothing But a Hero's socially and
historically relevant tracks, including  "Mother Earth," "Harriet Tubman,"
and “Today Mandela was Released from Jail,” offer a critical
alternative to the structural and representational violences of mainstream
children’s media entertainment. Why Me?—the story of young Squiggy’s
lousy day—makes visible the inadequacies of Canadian multicultural
discourse by revealing how Squiggy's frustrations are linked to social
relations of class, gender, and race."[BIO]"Lillian Allen is recognized as

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"In conversation with media activist and freelance journalist,
Sheila Nopper, Lillian Allen discusses the origins of dub poetry and its
contemporary manifestations and intersections with reggae music and social
justice movements. Allen reads dub poetry selections—“Knife Edge of
Good Womanhood”; “To the Child”; and “Nelly Belly Swelly”—that
show how she has helped expand the forms of rap, hip-hop, and dub poetry to
feminist content and sensibilities. As Nopper writes: "Lillian Allen is a
vocal resistor who has broken many barriers of silence about female culture
and identity. She has utilized her voice and her poetics to challenge
explicitly and implicitly, the power relationship within society, between
men and women and among women. She dared to be different, to call into
question norms of society. Allen has stood up for her rights, followed her
inner voice, her truth and her spirit. In so doing, she has validated not
only her own existence but the existence of female culture" (“Vocal
Resistors” Herizons Magazine, vol 11, no. 3, 1997)."[BIO]"Lillian Allen

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Lillian Allen’s “Revolution From de Beat” examines the
integral relationship between rhythm, language, dance, and revolution.
Presented here as a dub poetry music video, “Revolution” hails a
contemporary diasporic audience with its invocation of the talking drum
rhythms of Africa, which were used to spread the message of revolt to
slaves across the Atlantic."[BIO]"Lillian Allen is recognized as a key
originator and a leading exponent of dub poetry—a highly politicized form
of poetry that is sometimes set to music and is considered a literary
godmother of rap, hip-hop and spoken word poetry. Originally from Spanish
Town, Jamaica, Allen has been an influential figure on the global cultural
landscape for over four decades. She is credited with opening up the form
of dub poetry to enlist and engage feminist content and sensibilities. Her
albums Revolutionary Tea Party and Conditions Critical won Juno awards in
1986 and 1988 respectively. Allen’s multi-disciplinary and experimental
creativity extends across many genres. In addition to being an
award-winning and internationally renowned poet and writer of short stories
and plays, Allen was the instigator, co-producer and host of WORDBEAT,
CBC's national radio show on poetry and the spoken word; she is featured in
the films Revolution from de Beat (1995); Unnatural Causes (1989); Rhythm
and Hardtimes (1998); and co-produced/co-directed Blak … Wi Blakk’
(1994), a documentary film on Jamaican dub poet Mutabaruka which premiered
at the Toronto International Film Festival. She is a professor of creative
writing at Ontario College of Art and Design University (OCADU).

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Nohayquiensepa (No one knows) is a multidisciplinary performance
that uses video, storytelling, and movement to expose the human rights
abuses committed by Canadian, American, and British mining companies along
the Magdalena River in Colombia. Grounded in the pursuit of justice and an
end to indifference to human suffering, this liminal performance primarily
dwells in the spaces between state-sanctioned violence and mourning the
losses of those both known and unknown. First opening the performance with
ritualistic candle lighting and movement, Nohayquiensepa becomes a
continuous act of rememberance and an embodied account of the nameless,
faceless figures enacting and being acted upon by corporate greed and
violations of human rights."[BIO]"Aluna Theatre is an intercultural and
interdisciplinary theatre company creating artistically innovative and
socially engaged performance with a focus on Latin-Canadian and women
artists. Founded in Toronto in 2001 by Beatriz Pizano and Trevor
Schwellnus, Aluna Theatre aims to address the lack of cultural diversity on
Canadian stages and to place social justice, equality, and human rights at

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Set amidst live security footage, this play explores the
individual and collective paranoia that results from a world obsessed with
security. Throughout the performance, Beatriz Pizano tests her friendship
with Lyon Smith by examining what might be considered "incriminating
details" from his everyday life. Though their performatic use of
interrogation tactics and acts of confession, Aluna Theatre stages a modern
eulogy for the human cost of those actions taken by the state in order to
“protect” our collective safety."[BIO]"Aluna Theatre is an

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"La Comunión is the story of a Colombian woman, Pantera, who
fought as a child soldier during the civil war. After six years of
fighting, she escapes to Toronto using a fake identity, and struggles to
adjust to life as a civilian in Canada. The superscript translations
projected onto the stage reflect the protagonist's identitarian conflicts
as she oscillates between adjusting to life in Canada and the Colombian
past she carries on and with her. As the audience travels with Pantera from
jungle to town and back again, an abducted journalist and his daughter,
another female comandante and others, become a part of Pantera's journey.
Each character helps to reveal the socioeconomic, gender, and sexual
complexities at stake as well as the human cost of political warfare.
Overtly refusing to show weapons on stage, La Comunión is an exploration
of violence and a gesture towards a bloodless pursuit of freedom."[BIO]"Aluna

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"(Dis)connection considers experiences of erasure, vulnerability,
community, and connection as moments of connection and of rupture. The
dance draws motifs from the shorter piece Some of Our Parts, from the same
year. This piece, however, foregoes humor, instead working with darker,
more intense, and more intimate sides of in/visibility, dis/connection, and
community. The piece was performed six times, each iteration with a
slightly different cast, which worked to shift audience reception based on
the presumed visibility of disability. This dance was partially funded by
Orchesis Dance Society."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The Collaborative Radically

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"(Dis)quiet in the Peanut Gallery is a co-created performance
ethnography based on dancers’ experiences of exclusion, marginalization,
alienation, paternalism, and violence around issues of disability,
citizenship, and body size. One of CRIPSiE’s more theatrical works, it
moves through various trajectories of violence, and ultimately toward
actions of solidarity and resistance. Far from an identity-based
exploration, the piece explores how compulsory ableism intersects with
gendered and nationalist violences in ways that (unequally) impact every
person on stage."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The Collaborative Radically Integrated
Performers Society in Edmonton, is committed to fostering high quality,
creative, anti-oppressive and inclusive art practices and performances.
CRIPSiE is run by artists who experience disability or other forms of
oppression, and by their artistic and political allies. The group strives
for crip and mad aesthetics in their work. Crip and mad aesthetics involve
celebrating and exploring the generative possibilities of 'disability' and
'mental illness,' in terms of how these experiences can offer important
alternative perspectives on art processes, form, and content.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Dis-integrated Dance explores the ideas of generative
disintegration and decomposition, where break-down allows for access to new ways of relating. Dis-integration is about bodies and politics. It is about interrogating social and personal compulsions to normalize. It is about making visible the tools every human uses to navigate their physical and social worlds. It is about disintegrating how we know ourselves and each other. Dis-integration rejects the notion of disability-as-tragedy, while holding together the difficult and beautiful experiences of our everyday lives."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The Collaborative Radically Integrated Performers Society in Edmonton, is committed to fostering high quality, creative, anti-oppressive and inclusive art practices and performances.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Dis-Integration: Interrogations includes four short vignettes
based loosely on Danielle Peers’s auto-ethnographic article
"Interrogating Disability." In each vignette, a disembodied voice
interrogates a different cast member, repeating the kinds of questions that
cast member fields daily from family members, doctors, and complete
strangers. The questions and answers are curated and re-enacted, pointing
not only to the ableist, but also the sexist, sanist, and eugenic logics
that underlie such ubiquitous questions, as well as their entitled
imposition on our lives."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The Collaborative Radically

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Dis-integration: Swallowed the Fly engages choreographer Lindsay
Eales’s dark, humorous, and expansive adventures with both madness and
mental health interventions by interweaving allusions to two childhood
stories: Alice in Wonderland and The Woman who Swallowed the Fly. Using a
mad performance art aesthetic, Eales ties together the normalizing forces
and discourses of misogyny and the medicalization of madness. Further, she
questions the iatrogenic domino effect of medicalization, whereby it
becomes nearly impossible to distinguish between the embodied experiences
of madness and of pharmaceutical intervention. An earlier version of this
work was commissioned by Stage Left Productions."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The

experience of being diagnosed with mild Cerebral Palsy and how that has
shaped her perspectives and identity. Working with text, audio samples, and
some physical movement work, this piece reflects upon the numerous
pressures and experiences of growing up on the fringes of disability:
questions of passing, practices of rehabilitation, anxieties around
sexuality, and moments of utter optimism and failure."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Les Étoiles takes loose inspiration from Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince––working through themes of
friendship, longing, journeying, home, creativity, care, loss, and death,
which are ever-present realities of living in crip community. The creation
process was also inspired by artists who grouped together based on what
they most wanted to improve: story-telling, weight-sharing, interdependent
movement, and relationships. As with many CRIPSiE processes, most of the
movement was created by these grouped dancers in conversation with the
choreographer, who then used the pieces to construct a whole."[BIO]"CRIPSiE,

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"New Constellation emerged out of the many barriers two dancers
experienced at a human rights conference. In the performance, long ribbons
form barriers across the stage, which each dancer navigates in their own
way, sometimes with collaboration. Once they tear down barriers, dancers
tap into the generativity of moving in crip community together. CRIPSiE’s
first film, New Constellations, is based on the making of this
dance."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The Collaborative Radically Integrated Performers

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Otherwise is a dance-poem on film, based on the formation of
Queer-Crip and Queer-Mad identity and affinities between the two
dancer-filmmakers. It plays with identification and dis-identification and,
in particular, the ways in which violent words and disciplinary gazes are
transformed through the politicization of not only disability and madness,
but also of intimacy and care. In order not to reproduce the othering gaze
through objective, normate-voiced visual descriptions, the descriptions are
beautifully and poetically stuttered by a fellow crip, Joshua St.
Pierre."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The Collaborative Radically Integrated Performers

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Shelter is the tender and intimate portrayal of an
intergenerational cycle of care. The piece is centered on the perspective
of a disabled child who grows up to become the primary caregiver for her
aging mother. This is the first choreography of emerging artist Alison
Neuman, and was co-choreographed by Kelsie Acton."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Some of Our Parts uses humor to highlight community experiences
of invisibility and hypervisibility. In particular, this performance plays
with the notion of invisible disability, as well as with the paradox of
hyper/in-visibility experienced by those who are more identifiable.
Refusing the medicalized gaze through the obstructed view, the piece
enables dancers to decide what they want to show and how."[BIO]"CRIPSiE,

commitment to fight tooth and nail for a more just world. Dancers were
asked to build their characters out of the monsters they fight, the
monsters they love, and the monsters they’ve become."[BIO]"CRIPSiE, The

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"The performance begins with an introduction by BAAD! Co-Director Charles
Rice-González. Next, a black and white film of Arthur
Aviles dancing in the nude is shown, followed by a modern dance solo performed on stage
with dramatic classical music. Another black and white film is shown with
footage of the Bronx's Hunts Point neighborhood with specific
reference to architecture and Latino and Black identities. The contrast of
film and live performance on stage can be read as the contrast between
different movement vocabularies—pedestrian and modern. 

The entire cast of ""El Pato Feo""—a slang reference in Spanish for
homosexual identity—takes the stage in animal costumes. The mother of the
young, closeted El Pato Feo narrates her son’s coming-of-age as a queer
duckling. Over the course of the monologue, we learn the hardships that the
young El Pateo experienced coming out to the duck community, which included
being gay-bashed and teased. El Pato Feo's journey alludes to moments in
Arthur Aviles' life as an out and proud, self-proclaimed Puerto Rican
faggot and dancer. At the end of the performance, El Pato Feo spreads his
feathers in pride and affirms his confidence as a mature gay duck through a
lip-synced performance of the dance floor classic ""Change"" by Lisa
Stansfield." [BIO]"Arthur Aviles is a queer Puerto Rican Dancer/Choreographer
based in the Bronx, New York. Aviles was a member of the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from 1987 to 1995, and later formed Arthur
Aviles Typical Theatre—a dance company based in the Bronx whose mission
is to create works that play on the margins of gay and Latino cultures. The
company is housed at the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), which was
founded in 1998 by Aviles and his partner Charles Rice-González, a
creative writer and community activist. Aviles’ work utilizes aspects of
theater and dance, often taking the structure of stories from existing
classics and reconfiguring them in order to express the felt, actual and
fantastical lives of queer Latinos living in the ghetto. He received a
Bachelors of Arts in Theater/Dance from Bard College under the direction of
Jean Churchill, Lenore Latimer, Albert Reid, Susan Osberg and Aileen
Passloff, and was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater in
2015."

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"The performance opens with "Cookin with Petro" by Elizabeth
"Macha" Marrero—a comical monologue about making Puerto Rican eggnog for
Christmas. Charles Rice-González gives an introduction before Elizabeth
"Macha" Marrero takes the stage to deliver a lecture on "cunt-ology," where
she explains the anatomy of the vagina. The lecture is followed by a film
with Marrero playing Professor Lois Findovitch, who critiques and comments
upon a number of artworks featuring cunt imagery in the exhibit “KUNT:
The Goddess Within.” After the exhibit lecture, Marrero takes the stage
as a new character that explains her coming out story. In the next scene,
Marrero plays the butch character MC/DJ Willy Rizo who gets a “bush
whacking” (haircut) on film at a local barber shop then appears on stage
to deliver a monologue about “bush,” a pun that refers to both
getting a hair cut and the Republican president, but also refers to the
trimming of pubic hair on a vagina and having sexual intercourse with a
woman. Marrero then plays a teenage schoolgirl who makes reference to the
"todo bible” that teaches women how to embrace their womanhood and
includes an index of multiple terminologies for the cunt. Each character
played by Morrero earlier in the performance returns to the stage for one
last act that affirms the cunt."[BIO]Elizabeth Marrero is a performance
artist/comedian/drag king. Marrero, also known as Macha the papi chulo drag
king, burst onto the club scene with her drag king act in 1999 and
continues to present this character in diverse manifestations. She began
her performance career with dancer/choreographer Arthur Aviles, performing
the role of Maeva in over a dozen dance pieces for the past 15 years. In
2003 she appeared in Arthurella at Dance Theatre Workshop. In 2001 she
premiered Machataso: A One Woman Cho’ in BAAD! ASS WOMEN 2001 which had a
three week, sold-out, extended run. For “Out Like That” in June 2006,
Marrero produced and performed the first ever drag king extravaganza at
BAAD!. Marrero has performed at Joe’s Pub and other venues in New York
City and internationally. She lives in the Bronx where she was born. In
2003 she received a BRIO (Bronx Recognizes Its Own) Award from the Bronx
Council on the Arts.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre presents ""Intoxicating Calm"" and
""A Typical New York Rican"" as part of Bard College's alumni dance
concert. ""Intoxicating Calm"" is a solo by Arthur Aviles in which he
performs quick, rigorous, athletic phrases that form movement and character
sketches reflective of his internal feelings. In ""A Typical New York
Rican"" Aviles is joined by Elizabeth ""Macha" Marrero and Chikako
Yamauchi in a dance theater piece exploring radicalized ideas and
stereotypes and vindicating the identity of the typical "New York Rican."
Marrero discusses gentrification in the South Bronx, the lack of identity
politics in the dance world, and the lifestyle and culture of a New York
Rican among other groups in New York City. Aviles and Yamauchi perform
movement phrases that abstract and animate Marrero's monologue throughout
the performance."[BIO]"Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre (AATT) is a
Bronx-based modern dance company committed to creating a repertoire of
works that explore life on the margins of Latino and gay cultures, and to
bring these works to local, national and international audiences. AATT
debuted in France in April 1996 with MAÉVA AND THE FLOATING MAN. Aviles
moved the company to the Bronx that same year."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Dorothur's Journey is Arthur Aviles' second piece centered on
the world of the Wizard of Oz, following Maéva de Oz: A New York Rican
Ensalada. While Maéva was a theatrical piece primarily focused on a
monologue, Dorothur's Journey is completely danced. The references lie in
the music, on the screen/projector, and in the props and outfits. The
choreography presents a a gay Puerto Rican rendition of story, through a
fabulation characteristic of Aviles' work and his ways of disidentifying
with fables in order to create an autobiographical and political
work."[BIO]"Arthur Aviles is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer
based in the Bronx, New York. Aviles was a member of the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Morning Dance is a video-dance performance by Arthur Aviles,
filmed by Richard Shpuntoff. In this collaboration, Arthur undresses and
dances in front of a simple linen, illuminated only by the morning light
that pours in from a window in a quiet Queens, NY neighborhood. At the
performance's end, Arthur faces the camera before exiting the
frame."[BIO]"Arthur Aviles is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer
based in the Bronx, New York. Aviles was a member of the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur
Aviles Typical Theatre, a dance company based in the Bronx that seeks to
create work that plays on the margins of gay and Latino cultures. The
company is housed at the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), which was
founded in 1998 by Aviles and Charles Rice-González, a creative writer
and community activist. Aviles’ work utilizes aspects of theater and
dance, often taking the structure of stories from existing classics and
reconfiguring them in order to express the felt, actual, and fantastical
lives of queer Latinos living in the ghetto. He received a Bachelors of
Arts in Theater/Dance from Bard College under the direction of Jean
Churchill, Lenore Latimer, Albert Reid, Susan Osberg, and Aileen Passloff.
He was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater in 2015."

stomping leg movements. In "Maéva: A New York Rican's Ensalada" a group of
dancers combine ethnic dance with traditional forms and later the character
Maéva performs a monologue about her mother."[BIO]"Arthur Aviles Typical

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This video features footage from various solo and group performances of Arthur Aviles and/or the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater Company from 1991-2000. The footage includes the following performances:
 "Intoxicating Calm" (1992), a solo by Arthur Aviles in which he performs quick, rigorous, athletic phrases that form movement and character sketches reflective of his internal feelings.
"Untitled #1: After Martha Graham" (1994) is a piece where Arthur inspires himself in the movement vocabulary of choreographer Martha Graham, reimagining her Diversion of Angels, and of course, dancing all three of them. ""If I see something I like, why shouldn't I use it, especially it it inspired me? Originilaty is dead, but inspiration is alive. I put myself into that artwork and see what it does for me,"" said Aviles in an interview with Lawrence M. La Fountain-Stokes.
"Ritual Dance" (2000) features a group of dancers wearing white costumes that emphasize upper body gestures as they clap and move across the floor with stomping leg movements.
"Arturella" (1996) is a queer interpretation of the fairy tale Cinderella. Aviles uses his “autobiographical fantasy” method to recast the classic tale as a gay romance set in the South Bronx’s Latino community. He integrates Spanish and Spanglish into the narrative and assigns Latino names to all the characters in the fairy tale. Most of the movement in the dance is copied from the cartoon characters featured in Walt Disney’s motion picture Cinderella. It also features traditional Puerto Rican danza steps, as well as movement taken from West Side Story. The dance’s soundtrack is a collage of music and sounds taken from Disney’s Cinderella. 
"This Great and Pleasant Asylum" (1999) is a duet with Arthur's partner and collaborator Charles Rice-González. As the fabric moves and unravels, their own love and intimacy comes up, disguised as choreography, to create a fissure in the narratives of loneliness, grief and death and in the racist and homophobic discourse of the 80s and early 90s through the gorgeous strength of racialized male partnership. Nude and joined by their mouths, they come out and fly away together.
"Maéva: A New York Rican's Ensalada" (1991) features a group of dancers who combine traditional Puerto Rican dance with Western forms, followed by the character Maéva who performs a monologue about her mother, in which she inquires on the ""ensalada"" that is to exist in between two distinct worlds and cultures - and how disidentification shapes that body.
"Narcissus" (1998) features Arthur and company performing a series of movement and contact phrases at varying speeds and levels to dramatic classical music.
"5 Star Dance" (1997) centers classical and contemporary movement techniques which are explicated across the dance floor to classical music.
"Elysian Fields" (1999) is a 15-dancer piece with choreography inspired by the dynamics of the visuals and editing from Michael Auder's video BROODING ANGELS: MADE FOR R.L.
"A Puerto Rican Faggot From America" (Danspace, 1996) is a dance piece where Aviles forgoes the use of text, music, and costume, leaving the audience to interpret the movement through the dance’s title. Throughout the performance, Aviles continuously moves in time and space while asserting his racial, sexual, and national identity. He dances nude as a political gesture to critique contemporary dance aesthetics and to expose his gay, Puerto Rican body amid the AIDS crisis. Aviles also expresses tension surrounding his self-proclaimed identity as a ""New York-Rican""—a Puerto Rican born in New York that is estranged from island language and culture. Ultimately, Aviles conjures a body politic that challenges stereotypes and phobias about gay men during the AIDS pandemic, especially in the Latino community. 
"Super Maéva de Oz" (2000) is a revised restaging of the original Maéva de Oz, in which company encircles Elizabeth Marrero's character, Maéva, while Maéva simultaneously unfolds a monologue exploring many of the characters in the Wizard of Oz, telling the story of a Latina coming out of the closet.
"Ritual Dance" (2000), in this version, features a smaller group of dancers wearing white costumes that emphasize upper body gestures as they clap and move across the floor while also performing stomping leg movements. 
"How to Stay Alive" (2000) is a solo dance of Arthur Aviles moving in a red dress to classical music, queering both gender roles and ballet form.

AATT debuted in France in April 1996 with MAÉVA AND THE FLOATING MAN. Aviles moved the company to the Bronx that same year.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]""I want to see the face of the Devil." Slowly, the phrase is
repeated as the camera zooms in on an old clock, about to mark the stroke
of midnight. In the dark, Arthur Aviles is naked, only adorned by
flanking blue and red lighting. Aviles begins posing as the Vetruvian Man
and continues with a series of sinuous contortions, dancing along with the
song and collapsing that stable body, in this haunting and mesmerizing
piece that debunks the humanity inherited by God and science." [BIO]"Arthur
Aviles is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer based in the Bronx,
New York. Aviles was a member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance
Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre,

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This Pleasant and Grateful Asylum was created for and premiered at
the Martha @ Mother series, presented by Richard Move and Janet Stapleton
March 3-5, 1999. The dance was inspired by Bill T. Jones' encouragement to
challenge suppression, oppression, and repression and is the second of a 4
part work called Things Which Transect Our Vision." The piece is a duet
with Arthur's partner and collaborator Charles Rice-González. As the
fabric moves and unravels, the foundation of their own love and intimacy
comes up, disguised as choreography, to create a fissure in the narratives
of loneliness, grief and death in the racist and homophobic discourse of
the 1980s and early 1990s through the gorgeous strength of racialized male
partnership. Nude and joined by their mouths, they come out and fly away
together.[BIO]Arthur Aviles is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This is rehearsal footage for the performance This Pleasant and Grateful Asylum. This piece was created for and premiered at
the Martha @ Mother series, presented by Richard Move and Janet Stapleton
March 3-5, 1999. The dance was inspired by Bill T. Jones' encouragement to
challenge suppression, oppression, and repression and is the second of a 4
part work called Things Which Transect Our Vision." The piece is a duet
with Arthur's partner and collaborator Charles Rice-Gonzalez. As the fabric
moves and unravels, the foundation of their own love and intimacy comes up,
disguised as choreography, to create a fissure in the narratives of
loneliness, grief and death in the racist and homophobic discourse of the
80s and early 90s through the gorgeous strength of racialized male
partnership. Nude and joined by their mouths, they come out and fly away
together.[BIO]Arthur Aviles is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer
based in the Bronx, New York. Aviles was a member of the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur
Aviles Typical Theatre, a dance company based in the Bronx that seeks to
create work that plays on the margins of gay and Latino cultures. The
company is housed at the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), which was
founded in 1998 by Aviles and Charles Rice-González, a creative writer
and community activist. Aviles’ work utilizes aspects of theater and
dance, often taking the structure of stories from existing classics and
reconfiguring them in order to express the felt, actual, and fantastical
lives of queer Latinos living in the ghetto. He received a Bachelors of
Arts in Theater/Dance from Bard College under the direction of Jean
Churchill, Lenore Latimer, Albert Reid, Susan Osberg, and Aileen Passloff.
He was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater in 2015.
Charles Rice-González is a writer, long-time Bronx LGBT activist,
co-founder of BAAD! The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance and a Distinguished
Lecturer at Hostos Community College - CUNY. His debut novel, Chulito
(Magnus 2011), has received awards and recognitions from American Library
Association (ALA) and the National Book Critics Circle. He’s the chair of
the board for The Bronx Council on the Arts and The National Association of
Latino Arts and Cultures.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]As part of the Jacob's Pillow festival, Arthur Aviles Typical
Theater presents a set of four pieces. The first is a solo danced to and titled after singer
Cheryl Lynn's "To Be Real." Next is Charles Rice González narrating "El
Yunque," a story about a young Nuyorican man's journey from the South Bronx
to the El Yunque rain forest in northeastern Puerto Rico. As he speaks
dancers enact and bring the story to life through movement phrases. Themes
surrounding homosexual desire, cross-cultural identity, and nationhood are
raised within the text and gestures. Arthur Aviles then dances a solo to a
song by Tito Puente while wearing a traditional Puerto Rican hat and performing
traditional movements. Following is the piece "La La Land," accompanied by
singer Donna Summer's "MacArthur Park." Finally, there is a question and
answer conversation. Together, the four pieces present Arthur and his
company's trajectory, showcasing their work and also the core of Arthur's
choreography: his relationship to his Puerto Rican heritage, and the influence
of gay pop culture. [BIO]Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre (AATT) is a
Bronx-based modern dance company committed to creating a repertoire of
works that explore life on the margins of Latino and gay cultures, and to
bring these works to local, national and international audiences. AATT
debuted in France in April 1996 with MAÉVA AND THE FLOATING MAN. Aviles
moved the company to the Bronx that same year.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Arthur performs a series of flowing and spinning movements in a
shimmering golden dress to live percussion. The movements made with the
costume reflect the imagery of pioneering modern dancer and choreographer
Martha Graham. Arthur makes different shapes and poses with the costume. He
removes the top portion of the shimmering golden dress, using it as a stage
to perform a set of gestures. Nude, Arthur increases the momentum of his
movement phrasing across the dance floor for the rest of the performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Arthur Aviles’ Arturella is a queer interpretation of the fairy
tale Cinderella. Aviles uses his “autobiographical fantasy” method to
recast the classic tale as a gay romance set in the South Bronx’s Latino
community. He integrates Spanish and Spanglish into the narrative and
assigns Latino names to all the characters in the fairy tale. Most of the
movement in the dance mirror the cartoon characters featured in
Walt Disney’s motion picture Cinderella. The performance also features traditional
Puerto Rican danza steps, as well as movement taken from West Side Story.
The dance’s soundtrack is a collage of music and sounds from
Disney’s Cinderella. 

Throughout the dance, the young Arturella (Arthur Aviles) is
searching for community. Adopted by the evil step Maéva (Elizabeth
Marrero) after his father died, Arturella faces hardships surrounding race,
economics, and sexuality. Arturella perseveres, however, with the help of
the Fairy God Maéva (Marrero) and finds his way to the Prince’s sweet-15
party (quinceañero). Arturella and the Prince (George Merced) dance
together, but Arturella abruptly leaves the party. He has to return home to
his evil step Maéva and evil stepsisters (Kaila Cordova and Alberto
Denis), leaving a rainbow ribbon behind for the Prince to find him. The
Prince searches for Arturella after the party and later rescues him from
his evil family with King Maéva (Marrero). As the fairytale ends, the
Prince and Arturella express their love for each other, punctuated by a
long kiss in silence. [BIO]Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre (AATT) is a
Bronx-based modern dance company committed to creating a repertoire of
works that explore life on the margins of Latino and gay cultures, and to
bring these works to local, national and international audiences. AATT

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]In this adaptation of the popular Shakespeare play, A Midsummer
Night's Dream, the performance is reimagined as a modern coming-of-age
story. The four lovers are Athenian parochial school students who sneak into the woods one night. Soon into their evening adventures, they are bewitched by spirits and begin to passionately switch lovers while delivering Shakespeare's classic verse in their underwear. The play's theme is "A Teenager in Love," and features musical interludes by artists such as The Bangles and Tracy Chapman. The spirit world is made of shadow puppets
operated by Cornerstone members. [BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a
multi-ethnic ensemble company based in Los Angeles California. For over 30
years Cornerstone has commissioned more than 100 award-winning playwrights,
produced over 150 new plays for the American Theater, trained thousands of
students, and impacted tens of thousands of community members across the
U.S., with many experiencing theater for the first time. Cornerstone was
founded in 1986 as a traveling ensemble, which adapted classic works to
tell the stories of both rural and urban communities. The theater has also
seeded a troupe called Teatro Jornalero Sin Fronteras (Day Laborer Theater
Without Borders), in partnership with the National Day Laborer Organizing
Network and funding from the Ford Foundation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Tartoof (Or An Imposter in Norcatur-and at Christmas!) (1987) is
an adaptation of Moliére's Tartuffe, and is a study of relationships in a
disintegrating farm community in rural Norcatur, Kansas. Along with
performers from Cornerstone Company, the play featured a cast and crew of
local Kansas residents. In this adaptation, the family is torn apart by
their house guest and may lose the family farm. It's also Christmastime- a
time known for family and togetherness, making it a compelling
juxtaposition of reunion and disintegration—just when they are supposed
to be coming together they are instead coming apart.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]"Waking Up in Lost Hills (2004) is an original adaptation of the
Rip Van Winkle tale and is based on the stories of those in the agricultural
community in Lost Hills, California. The play opens with the actors asleep
on the floor of the auditorium, forcing audience members to step over and
around them as they find their seats. As the tale begins, the town wakes
and audiences follow the story of almond farmer Victorio Valenzuela, now
revived from a decades long sleep. He meets The Traveler, and they set on a
mission to rescue the town of Lost Hills. Playwright Jose Cruz Gonzalez and
director Bill Rauch collaborated with eighteen adult students from across
the country, professional artists and community members to present this
magical tale about a town awakening. The play had a cast of 44, including
28 community members. [BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]An adaptation of Brecht's 'Good Woman of Setzuan' set in the
timber and ranching community of Long Creek, Oregon, staged in a cattle
barn. Three Angels arrived on Earth, and they are looking for just one Good
Person. They pin their hopes on Shinny Tinny, a Portland prostitute, and
leave her with a thousand dollars, a pat on the head and a challenge: be
good and stay good. Shinny Tinny moves back to her hometown, Long Creek,
and opens "Shinny's", a new café. She tries to be good -- to be generous
to those in need, to love one man with all her heart, to prepare a good
life for her unborn child -- but before long, she needs help. The Angels
are nowhere in sight, and so she turns to herself. Or rather, a version of
herself in slacks and a necktie: her make-believe cousin who knows what to
do when being good just isn't enough. Shinny Tinny tries to do good things.
She has good intentions. She makes good turkey casseroles and a very good
cup of coffee. But, she finds, even in Long Creek, it is sometimes hard to
be good. [BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic ensemble

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Set in a contemporary Rust Belt city and performed in the basement
of City Hall, this adaptation of Chekhov focused on Appalachian
out-migration. The Cornerstone version focuses on the dissatisfactions,
unhappiness, family tensions and homesickness of a transplanted West
Virginia coal-mining family and their associates. With its West Virginian
characters, the play illustrates, as does Chekhov's original, that an
understanding of one group of people and their feelings may help us to
understand others who have had similar experiences and borne similar
burdens. [BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic ensemble

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Boda de luna nueva: New Moon Wedding (2005) is based on Federico
Garcia Lorca’s Blood Wedding. This rendition was created in collaboration
with residents of Grayson, Westley, and Vernalis in California. The cast of
48 included 35 local residents, with 10 community members serving on the
backstage crew. Performed on the basketball courts of the newly opened
United Community Center and Park, Peter Howard's bilingual adaptation of
classic Spanish play Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding) transplants the tragic
love story from the vineyards and wheat fields of old Spain to California's
rich apricot orchards and tomato fields. The plot follows a couple of
newlyweds that are torn apart after the bride decides to run off with an
old lover, right after the ceremony. The party storms into the forest
searching for the couple, culminating in the death of both of the wife's
lovers. [BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic ensemble company

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Baron and Esther have lost their house. Dreamer knows Pacoima is
all good. Low knows Pacoima is all bad. Candy isn't sure. This Pacoima
tale of optimism follows the journey of a family confronted with the
community they cannot run away from. Through a madcap adventure with
dueling car washes, a scary bus stop, and a street vendor with
stories to tell, they discover that there is no place like home and that every
community has troubles and treasures. 
A collaboration with Pacoima, a working class neighborhood in the northeast
cornerstone of the city of Los Angeles, this play was created using
Cornerstone’s Story-Circle methodology. The cast of 54 included 43 local
residents and 8 more community members worked backstage.  Performed at
Project Youth Green Community Garden in Pacoima's Jessup Park.
[BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic ensemble company based
in Los Angeles California. For over 30 years Cornerstone has commissioned
more than 100 award-winning playwrights, produced over 150 new plays for
the American Theater, trained thousands of students, and impacted tens of
thousands of community members across the U.S., with many experiencing
theater for the first time. Cornerstone was founded in 1986 as a traveling
ensemble, which adapted classic works to tell the stories of both rural and
urban communities. The theater has also seeded a troupe called Teatro
Jornalero Sin Fronteras (Day Laborer Theater Without Borders), in
partnership with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and funding
from the Ford Foundation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Residents and other members of Los Angeles’ Downtown Arts
District collaborated to present this original play based on the history
and life of this diverse and dynamic neighborhood. In Alison Carey’s
adaptation of Shakespeare’s most popular play, A Midsummer’s Night
Dream, magic happened in the desert rather than in the woods. Fairies
became mirages. The play-within-the-play was performed by local crops (ie:
Peter Quince is a Watermelon) rather than mechanicals, and the culminating
event of the play was Holtville's annual Carrot Festival rather than a
royal wedding. Laurie Woolery directed the 62 cast members, which included
52 local residents onstage & one as backstage crew. Approximately 810
people attended the performances at Finley Elementary Auditorium.
[BIO]Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic ensemble company based
in Los Angeles California. For over 30 years Cornerstone has commissioned
more than 100 award-winning playwrights, produced over 150 new plays for
the American Theater, trained thousands of students, and impacted tens of
thousands of community members across the U.S., with many experiencing
theater for the first time. Cornerstone was founded in 1986 as a traveling
ensemble, which adapted classic works to tell the stories of both rural and
urban communities. The theater has also seeded a troupe called Teatro
Jornalero Sin Fronteras (Day Laborer Theater Without Borders), in
partnership with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and funding
from the Ford Foundation.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]The story is of three generations of women in one
family, their desire to forge better lives for themselves and stronger
bonds, and also the struggles unique to Latina agricultural workers. From the
lettuce fields of 1963 to the stores and streets of modern day Alisal,
this play celebrates the triumphs and heartbreaks of these women. Plumas Negras
is layered with an indigenous poetry of ordinary, mythic crows. The first
part is performed in Spanish which shifts to Spanglish and eventually gives primacy to English. Cornerstone had support from both Vineyard Church in
Alisal and Salinas Valley Community Church in North Salinas who all made the
residency possible. Alisal Center for the Fine Arts was a partner as well
and served as the performance venue. The cast of 39 performers included 27 residents and was presented as part of Cornerstone's tenth annual Institute Summer
Residency. Plumas Negras was informed and inspired by the stories and
perspectives of local residents in Alisal. The play was commisioned by
Playwrights Circle members Stuart & Susan Brenton, Angelina Fiordellisi &
Matt Williams, Byron Gross & Ricky Tovim, Tom Jacobson & Ramone Muñoz,
Melody Kanschat, Dennis & Joanne Keith, Pat Mock & Peg Yorkin.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This adaptation of the classic myth of Jason and the Golden
Fleece included local stories of veterans, seniors, Victorian architecture
enthusiasts, artists and craftspeople, homeless and houseless people,
students, and caregivers. In this telling Jason is a young warrior with physical and
emotional wounds, who has taken to sleeping on the lawn of a west side
Eureka Victorian house. Here, two stories unfold: the epic adventures of
Jason’s quest to capture the fabled Golden Fleece, and the local
reactions to this mysterious stranger’s presence in an eclectic Eureka
neighborhood. Playwright Peter Howard mixes elements of the classic tale of
Jason & the Argonauts with realities of present-day Eureka, blurring the
lines between mythic and the local heroes that exist among us every day. The play was performed outdoors at The Blue Ox Millworks and Historic Park Sanctuary Stage and Ink People Center for the Arts were also great community partner organizations. The cast of 37 included 30 community members and 14 local residents also served on the technical crew.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]A mysterious traveler named Flor appears in a field of California
wildflowers overlooking the land identified in author John Steinbeck’s Grapes of
Wrath. This collaboration with the South Kern County community of Arvin and
the neighboring towns of Lamont & Weedpatch explored the commonalities
between the Oklahoma Dustbowl immigrants of the 1930s and more recent
immigrants from Mexico and Central America who find themselves in
California, also because of strenuous circumstances. Arvin High School staff
and administration generously hosted the performances in the school's auditorium. Community partners and advisors included SouthKernSol.org, FIELD
Arvin Learning Center, Arts Council of Kern, Don Burkett, Maria Mercado,
Javier Arreola, the Garcia Family, the Martinez Family, Nina Pickett
Carter, Larry Hallam, Gene Lundquist and Dr. Jim Young. [BIO]Cornerstone

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Billionaires for Bush (or Gore) is a street performance protest staged at the
Philadelphia Republican National Convention in 2000. Largely seen as
"Culture jamming political theater" according to Wikipedia, Billionaires
for Bush satirically marched in favor of the convention with slogans such as,
"Corporations are people too," "This is what plutocracy looks like," and
"Who's street? Wall Street!"
Mike Rosoft gives an interview to the media about the group's core
beliefs. Reverend Billy's sermon for the overpriveleged minority follows.
Phil T. Rich reminds viewers that "Inequality hasn't been growing fast
enough." Milly O'Naire then concludes with her rendition of the Billionaire
Blues. Footage of the parade and march in downtown Philadelphia is next,
with a float shaped like a giant wrestling ring featuring a presidential
smackdown. Nixon and Reagan wave to the adoring public while straddling
weapons of mass destruction and guzzling oil from Occidental Petrol spouts
coming out of the corner turnbuckles. [BIO] Billionaires for Bush is a
grassroots network of corporate lobbyists, decadent heiresses, Halliburton
CEOs, and other winners under George W. Bush's economic policies.
Headquartered on Wall Street, and with over 60 chapters nationwide,
Billionaires for Bush worked tirelessly to ensure the success of Bush-era
policies that put profits over people.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Ivy and Monet get a call from the Big Dick Himself, as Vice President Cheney calls in to dismiss rumors that the Bush Administration is worried about fallout from the Valerie Plame leak. When US diplomat Joseph C. Wilson publicly contradicts George Bush's assertion about using uraniam in Niger for constructing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the White House punishes him, betraying his wife's identity as a covert CIA operative. Valerie Plame's identity was revealed to the press by the Vice President's Chief of Staff Scooter Libby who is later convicted of perjury and obstruction of Justice. [BIO]Billionaires for Bush is a grassroots network of corporate lobbyists, decadent heiresses, Halliburton
CEOs, and other winners under George W. Bush's economic policies.
Headquartered on Wall Street, and with over 60 chapters nationwide,
Billionaires for Bush worked tirelessly to ensure the success of Bush-era
policies that put profits over people. billionairesforbush.com

    [SUMMARY]News anchor Monet Oliver DePlace responds to fan mail while co-anchor Ivy League-Legacy travels to Ketchikan, Alaska. There, she investigates Republican Representative Don Young's achievements in pork barrell spending, including the "Bridge to Nowhere," an infrastructural snafu that would connect the town of Ketchikan (population 8,900) with its airport on the Island of Gravina (population 50) at a cost to federal taxpayers of $320 million, all thanks to Bush's Highway Bill.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Broadcast 1: There's a growing social security crisis: Wall Street

League-Legacy address the Bush administration's latest efforts to auction
off America's federal aid to the highest bidder.
Broadcast 2: Limit Victims' Rights! Ivy League-Legacy anchors a segment on
the Bush administration's new legislation meant to reduce corporate

polluted shores of a chemical plant to describe how jury selection and
illegal corruption can cut off those class action lawsuits at the
knees!
Broadcast 3: With credit card companies profiting from predatory loans and
sky high interest rates, reporter Ivy League-Legacy calls in from her new
yacht—the S.S. WriteOff—to explain how the Bush Administration's new
bankruptcy policy can be a creative accounting tool for billionaires like
you and me.
Broadcast 4: Tax Day is here and the income gap is at an all time high!
Special guest Buddy O' Bush calls in from the Oval Office to thank
America's children for paying off the country's deficit with their future
labor. Reporter Shirley Loaded interviews billionaires on the street in

Xena Phobe reports live from Los Angeles to track how billions of income
tax dollars are funneled from working class families to Enron shareholders.
Broadcast 5: Clean air: Can't sell it! Who needs it? With Congress finally
delivering on President George Bush's promise to open protected lands to
drilling, mining and logging corporations, the race is on to make Mother
Nature a cash cow. Monet Oliver DePlace reports from Yosemite National Park
to teach everyday citizens how to turn any 500 year old sequoia into a
money tree!
Broadcast 6: Monet Oliver DePlace and Ivy League-Legacy detail Republican
Tom DeLay's ethics cleansing in the House of Representatives. Buddy O' Bush
phones in from Capitol Hill to defend the beleagured lobbyist from
allegations that his congressional influence was routinely bought and sold
to the highest bidder. [BIO]Billionaires for Bush is a grassroots network

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520): [SUMMARY]The performance Our Vision Our Future is an effort by Billionaires for Bush to "promote American leadership that builds billionaire equity." In this satirical talk show program, co-hosts Jennifer Fairmont and Forrest Winnower III entertain a series of billionaire special guests who tell it like it is. This raison d'etre gives you the facts the liberal left wing media won't. War? That's money in the bank. Terrorism? Not a problem. Taxes? Meant for the poor. If you need help navigating the difficult challenges of a life with more than one thousand million dollars, you'll definitely want to heed this call to build a richer future.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
[SUMMARY]Billionaires for Bush share some of their best satire in this compilation, which includes:
- Political tv commercials! As US casualties and war debts pile up from the Iraq War, it's always great to remember why we're fighting. Here's a hint: it's not freedom, Uncle Sam... it's that black gold that warms our hearts! Stay tuned!
- Hip-Hop videos! MC 50 Mil spits hot bars and gives us a sneak peak at the young black Billionaire lifestyle. Keep it real in this cringeworthy imitation of ealy 2000's rap videos, complete with gaudy mansion, flashy rental cars, and scantilty clad women! Because sometimes even a landed billionaire wants to party like the nouveau rich!
- Street interventions with trained imposters! The Billionaires show up in New York City to intercept Karl Rove on his way to meet George W. Bush's Maverick fundraisers. With environmentalists already on hand protesting the administration's response to the September 11th attacks, it's a good old-fashioned protest party!
- Environmentalist Party Crashing! Phil T Rich and Monet Oliver De Place crash the stage at a Bioneer's conference, dropping the cold hard facts to a captive audience of eco-apologists. Ever the orators, the silver-tongued Billionaires defend the Bush Administrations's healthy forest initiatives (such as logging) and extol the hidden virtues of global warming (great tans!) to the cackles and heckles of their political and ideological opposites. [BIO]Billionaires for Bush is a grassroots network of corporate lobbyists, decadent heiresses, Halliburton CEOs, and other winners under George W. Bush's economic policies. Headquartered on Wall Street, and with over 60 chapters nationwide, Billionaires for Bush worked tirelessly to ensure the success of Bush-era policies that put profits over people. billionairesforbush.com

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] In this footage from the 1985 Domestic Resurrection Circus, subtitled "Nicaragua and Bach," Bread and Puppet fused Western canonical music and theatrical styling with their signature puppetry and masks to address the Iran-Contra Affair and U.S.
involvement in Nicaragua. The circus's format is a parodic nod to side-show
carnival acts and "circus freaks" that, like much of their repertoire,
questions and disrupts what is commonly conceived of as "natural" and
"realistic." The name for the circus suggests understanding theater as
synonymous with the domestic and the every day, particularly as a means of
counteracting political apathy and commercialism.Perhaps the most recognized fixture of Bread and Puppet Theater's seasonal programming, Our Domestic Resurrection Circus was an annual gathering on the theater's farm near Glover, Vermont from 1970-1997. [BIO]The Bread and Puppet Theater was founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side. The theater’s puppet shows range from tightly composed theater
pieces presented by members of the company to extensive outdoor pageants
which require the participation of many community volunteers. Performances
occur in diverse venues, from international theater festivals to urban
community centers to rural elementary schools. Bread and Puppet’s impact
on the greater world of experimental theater is acknowledged by scholars,
and evidenced by the hundreds of unique theater companies now in existence
that cite Bread and Puppet as an influence. One of the most enduring
legacies of Bread and Puppet is its autonomy, receiving no direct
government funding, but instead relying on its own practice of frugality
and a huge amount of volunteerism, along with the merged incomes of
performance fees, and sales of Bread and Puppet Press’ posters and
publications, as well as donations to pay its own way. Bread & Puppet has
won numerous awards, including the Obie Award, the Erasmus Award from
Amsterdam, the Vermont Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts, the
Puppeteers of America Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous ribbons
in local Vermont parades in Hardwick and Barton. breadandpuppet.org

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Daily News Nativity (1985) is a secular retelling of the birth of
Jesus Christ. The script juxtaposes quotes and events detailed in the daily
news with stories and quotes from the New Testament in the Christian Bible.
The present-day evils of homelessness, displacement, and war resonate
across time and beliefs as parallels are drawn between Mary and Joseph
fleeing the wrath of King Herrod and their subsequent search for shelter.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]In this retrospective of the traveling show Columbus The New World
Order (1992), members of Bread and Puppet Theater reflect on the experience of staging the show exactly 500 years after Columbus' first voyage to the so-called New World.
Cast members also reflect on the show's critiques of colonization and imperialism that were
both of the moment and timeless. Bread and Puppet disrupts sanitized
versions of Columbus' celebrated history to honor those subjugated and
killed as part of Columbus' conquest. Columbus' story is
juxtaposed with detailed descriptions of weapons used in the Gulf War as
well as death rituals for Iraqi women killed during the conflict. [BIO] The
Bread and Puppet Theater was founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York
City’s Lower East Side. The theater’s puppet shows range from tightly
composed theater pieces presented by members of the company to extensive

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] The Door (1985) is a haunting play that explores the horrors
Guatemalan refugees experience on the journey north. The story unfolds with
a choreographed mix of actors, larger-than-life puppets, cardboard figures,
and masks depicting indigenous Guatemalans and the countless figures aiming
to harm and exploit them. Also seen are the extreme dangers faced in
migration and a brutal masacre. In one of the play's few spoken moments, a
disembodied voice reveals the U.S.'s role in this violence, noting the
country has shipped arms to Guatemala and has trained counter-insurgents since
the 1950s. The silence from the United States is symbolically linked to the
evil forces who loom behind the titular door, who remain largely silent and
obscured as they enact their violence. [BIO] The Bread and Puppet Theater
was founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side.
The theater’s puppet shows range from tightly composed theater pieces
presented by members of the company to extensive outdoor pageants which
require the participation of many community volunteers. Performances occur

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]The Bread and Puppet 1985 Traveling Circus is an outdoor
performance featuring the theater's signature puppets and masks. The show
intersperses recognizable circus gags and slapstick comedic acts with a
timeline detailing historic and present day political crises in Nicaragua,
and critiquing U.S. involvement. During the 1980s, Bread and Puppet Theater focused
heavily on the atrocities occuring in Central America—the Guatemalan
Civil War and the Iran-Contra Affair, among others—to critique the
corporate and political corruption at the root of these horrors, both
within the region and in the United States. [BIO]The Bread and Puppet Theater
was founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side.
The theater’s puppet shows range from tightly composed theater pieces
presented by members of the company to extensive outdoor pageants which
require the participation of many community volunteers. Performances occur
in diverse venues, from international theater festivals to urban community
centers to rural elementary schools. Bread and Puppet’s impact on the

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] The Hunger of the Hungry and the Hunger of the Overfed (1986)
explores the consumerism and greed at the core of preventable hunger and
food scarcity around the world. Throughout the play actions
take place in various global sites, revealing how the need for food may
manifest differently, but it is universal. In exploring both underfed and
overfed populations, the Bread and Puppet Theater situates hunger as a
moral dilemma: as the deprivation that ravages the body and spirit, and the
insatiable appetites leading some to hoard far more resources than they
need. The Hunger of the Hungry and the Hunger of the Overfed strikingly
articulates the ruinous effects of this imbalance. [BIO]The Bread and
Puppet Theater was founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York City’s
Lower East Side. The theater’s puppet shows range from tightly composed
theater pieces presented by members of the company to extensive outdoor
pageants which require the participation of many community volunteers.
Performances occur in diverse venues, from international theater festivals
to urban community centers to rural elementary schools. Bread and
Puppet’s impact on the greater world of experimental theater is
acknowledged by scholars, and evidenced by the hundreds of unique theater
companies now in existence that cite Bread and Puppet as an influence. One
of the most enduring legacies of Bread and Puppet is its autonomy,
receiving no direct government funding, but instead relying on its own
practice of frugality and a huge amount of volunteerism, along with the
merged incomes of performance fees, and sales of Bread and Puppet Press’
posters and publications, as well as donations to pay its own way. Bread &
Puppet has won numerous awards, including the Obie Award, the Erasmus Award
from Amsterdam, the Vermont Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts,
the Puppeteers of America Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous
ribbons in local Vermont parades in Hardwick and Barton. breadandpuppet.org

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] Bread and Puppet Theater's Icarus (1988) takes its inspiration
from the painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by Pieter Bruegel. In
this iteration, Icarus's tale is less a hubristic attempt at defying
gravity and more a cautionary warning about what is enacted and sacrificed
in the name of freedom. The setting is a small town near Colorado Springs,
Colorado, home to the North American Air Defense Command. There, the
population's sole focus is on self-protection and the preservation of the
North American continent in an aerospace battle they are certain is fast
approaching. While Icarus does achieve flight, he inevitably falls, in
spite of the society's preparedness and their isolating, singular focus on
self-preservation. His death sets off a domino effect of invasion and
destruction, leaving comrades and enemies fleeing what's left of the
burning continent, all in the same boat. [BIO] The Bread and Puppet Theater
was founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] Bread and Puppet's Washerwoman Nativity (1983) is a retelling of
the classic Christian nativity story through the lens of the archetypal
washerwoman. Featured throughout Bread and Puppet productions, washerwomen
symbolize the strength of women, especially those within the working
class. In this version of a familiar story, these women are central
characters in the birth of Jesus—as part of an overlooked population that
helps the community run effectively, and as targets of King Herrod's
terroristic response to the threat of lost power.
The company's communal focus and their celebrations of the everyday are
exemplified in the production: the cast is comprised of both company
members and people from the local community, and the play centers women
whose daily, important work is so integral to their communities and whose
labor is so often invisibilized. [BIO] The Bread and Puppet Theater was
founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side. The
theater’s puppet shows range from tightly composed theater pieces
presented by members of the company to extensive outdoor pageants which
require the participation of many community volunteers. Performances occur
in diverse venues, from international theater festivals to urban community
centers to rural elementary schools. Bread and Puppet’s impact on the
greater world of experimental theater is acknowledged by scholars, and
evidenced by the hundreds of unique theater companies now in existence that

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] Nativity: The Death of King Herrod re-imagines the events
surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ through a wry, political focus on
King Herrod's reign. Enacted on two stages are the king's paranoia about
the birth of a savior who will dethrone him, and the resulting infanticide
of male children throughout Israel. The infanticide became known as the Massacre of Innocents. This story runs parallel to contemporary events and the havoc wrought on
the masses by those wielding power. In one scene, King Herrod orders
taxation on every household, after which numerous citizens are interrogated
and murdered. In the following scene actors display statistics of
Guatemalan citizens murdered during the ongoing Guatemalan Civil War and
where their bodies were found. With highly detailed costumes, imagery, and
anthropomorphized characters, Bread and Puppet's version of the Christian
nativity subversively pivots to critique systems of power and their human
costs. [BIO]The Bread and Puppet Theater was founded in 1963 by Peter
Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side. The theater’s puppet shows
range from tightly composed theater pieces presented by members of the

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] The Bread and Puppet Theater ventures to Los Angeles to
participate in the 1990 L.A. Festival. They performed an abridged version
of Teatro Mundi, a piece nestled within the group's annual Domestic
Resurrection Circus. Bread and Puppet examines and critiuqes the political
events of the era, in this instance decrying President George H.W. Bush and
the 1989 invasion of Panama. In these scenes, the Cold War and Common Sense
are personified and locked in battle, a plotline juxtaposed with familiar
fairy tales turned on their heads. The characters and the absurdist
scenarios point to the folly of these late 20th century political
struggles. [BIO] The Bread and Puppet Theater was founded in 1963 by Peter
Schumann on New York City’s Lower East Side. The theater’s puppet shows

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]In the performance Zen for Mouth (after Nam June Paik) (2003),
calligraphy is written with a beef tongue dipped in used motor oil. The
artist draws a straight line for as long as is physically possible. This is
the first of three performances based on avant-garde composer La Monte
Young's Compositions 1960 Series: "Draw a straight line and follow it." -
Composition 1960 #10 to Bob Morris. [BIO]David Khang is a visual,
performance, and biological artist whose practice is informed by education
in psychology, theology, dentistry, and law. Khang selectively imbeds these
disciplinary codes into his work, to compose interdisciplinary languages
that materialize in visual, textual, and spoken forms. In performing, Khang
often embodies these languages to interrogate social constructions – of
gender, race, and interspecies relations – that are present within
dominant historic narratives in contemporary culture. By strategically
employing non-native languages and code switching, Khang produces
divergent, dissonant, and often hyperbolic and humorous readings that
re-imagine the poetic and the political.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]In this performance, the monarch butterflies are gently tethered to a silk string that is in turn sutured to the tongue, temporarily connecting bodies across
species. The butterflies are released, unharmed, at the end of the
piece. This is the second of three projects based on La Monte
Young’s Compositions 1960: "Turn a butterfly (or any number of
butterflies) loose in the performance area. When the composition is over,
be sure to allow the butterfly to fly away outside. The composition may be
any length but if an unlimited amount of time is available, the doors and
windows may be opened before the butterfly is turned loose and the
composition may be considered finished when the butterfly flies away." -
Composition 1960 #5. [BIO]David Khang is a visual, performance, and

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]This homoerotic and scatological performance is not only an
homage to Shigeko Kubota's Vagina Painting (1965) but, more urgently, a
tongue-in-cheek response to gendered and racialized representations and
readings of bodies in contemporary culture. 
"If Kubota challenged the works of male artists like Pollock, Klein, and
Paik––by counterposing the female body's productivity to the masculine
painterly gestures loaded with phallic symbolism––I want my work to be
read against two forces. First, (East) Asian calligraphy. Many
practitioners believe in a link between male virility and the strength of
his brush stroke, the brush tip standing in for the phallus. Through
scatological markmaking, I aim to 'pollute' this phallogocentrism. Second,
I want to interrogate the white gaze, and how the Asian body, or for that
matter, Asia as a body, is feminized (see Said)." - David Khang, an excerpt
from Interview with Glenn Alteen, brunt magazine, Issue #1. [BIO]David

perspectives of the "same" event, complicating the immediacy of performance
art as medium. [BIO]David Khang is a visual, performance, and biological

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]M. Butterfly (After Shigeko Kubota) is citational by design. In
1960, La Monte Young wrote his Composition 1960 #5, which instructs the
performer to “Turn a butterfly (or any number of butterflies) loose in
the performance area.” In 1965, Shigeko Kubota performed Vagina Painting
at the Perpetual Fluxus Festival, Cinemateque, NYC. In 1988, David Henry
Hwang’s play M. Butterfly premiered on Broadway, NYC. In 2007, these
historically significant pieces—all performed in NYC—become departure
points that converge in one re-mixed performance, with the potential for
divergent readings with contemporary social, political, racial, and sexual
implications. Through this piece, reinterpreting performance works from the
past becomes a means of re-imagining new poetic and political strategies
for the present. [BIO]David Khang is a visual, performance, and biological
artist whose practice is informed by education in psychology, theology,
dentistry, and law. Khang selectively imbeds these disciplinary codes into
his work, to compose interdisciplinary languages that materialize in
visual, textual, and spoken forms. In performing, Khang often embodies

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] Phalogocentrix reflects on constructions and the performativity
of language, which is at once gendered (phallocentric), and linguistically
and culturally determined (logocentric). Part calligraphy, part yoga, and
part breakdancing, this syncretic ritual explores African and Asian
cultural affinities and connectivities, within the theological context and
site of a church. By bringing together traditional and contemporary
cultural references, as well as trans-diasporic identities, this
performance encourages critical discourse on the relationships between
race, gender, and language. [BIO] David Khang is a visual, performance, and
biological artist whose practice is informed by education in psychology,
theology, dentistry, and law. Khang selectively imbeds these disciplinary
codes into his work, to compose interdisciplinary languages that

-----------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]El otro nueve once (con el tankecito) (2008) is a site-specific
public performance that took place at La Moneda, the Chilean presidential
palace. The project remembers the 1973 military coup led by General Augusto
Pinochet and supported by both the CIA and the Chicago School, which sought
to overturn Chile's socialist movement. A bicycle-powered miniature tank
(referencing the tanks used in the first coup, attempt earlier that year)
becomes the vehicle for reciting and remembering Salvador Allende's final
presidential speech before his death. The speech is read in Spanish and
Korean. The work is completed in Valdivia, Chile, as pink military fatigues
are painted copper––or cobre––one of the driving forces of the
Chilean economy, and one of the few industries that remained in public
control after the post-coup privatization. This performance is part of the
Wrong Places series, an ongoing series of site-specific public
performances. For each, Khang researched specific geopolitical histories
and juxtaposed and/or remixed seemingly disparate events. In this way,
Khang produces dissonant as well as consonant readings, and works to
re-imagine these events' poetic and political potentials. [BIO]David Khang

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]How to Feed a Piano (2008) is the third and final performance in
David Khang's series based on La Monte Young's Compositions 1960: "Bring a
bale of hay and a bucket of water onto the stage for the piano to eat and
drink. The performer may then feed the piano or leave it to eat by itself.
If the former, the piece is over after the piano has been fed. If the
latter, it is over after the piano eats or decides not to."  - Piano Piece
for David Tudor #1 (1960). Khang re-interprets the piece in the following
manner: "Feed the piano hay and water while accompanied by pianist(s).
Climb inside, and through the piano. Cover the front of the body in blue
paint. Be harnessed to the horse, and pulled along to draw a line. The
horse rider is a First Nations woman, or an Indian cowboy."  - Instructions

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] In 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial (Washington DC), Martin Luther
King, Jr. delivered his "I Have A Dream" speech for the American civil
rights movement. Forty-five years later, this speech is translated into
Korean, recited for an Anglophone audience, while wearing a Korean military
uniform painted in UN-blue. English words and phrases spliced into the
speech become cues for imbedded "assassins" to shoot pink paintballs at
the uniform, as well as at portraits of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Barack
Obama. After the performance, the blue uniform is painted pink (a reference
to the term "pinkos," used to label Communist sympathizers). Through the
conflicted emotional memory and prism of an era that represented hopes for
social justice, the contemporary political climate is re-interpreted and
reevaluated.
This is the second project in an ongoing series of site-specific public
performances titled Wrong Places. For each. Khang researched specific
geopolitical histories, and juxtaposed and/or remixed seemingly disparate
events. In this way, Khang produces dissonant as well as consonant
readings, and works to re-imagine these events' poetic and political
potentials. [BIO]David Khang is a visual, performance, and biological

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] The October Crisis of 1970 was a pivotal moment in 20th century
Canadian history. The Front de libération du Québec's kidnapping of James
Cross and Pierre Laporte were met by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s
invoking of the War Measures Act. Across Canada, civil liberties were
suspended as Canadian Forces patrolled Montréal streets. These events
fueled the already-swelling Québec sovereignty movement in the decades
that followed. Forty years later, how are these events remembered?
A Measure of War (Je me souviens) is a site-specific public performance in
which seemingly disconnected historical events and public speeches are
‘remixed’––both culturally and linguistically––encouraging our
collective amnesia to remember things as they never were. How do we
understand Trudeau’s speech on October 16, 1970, or the FLQ Manifesto,
when it is read not only in English and French––official languages of a
bilingual Canada––but in a third language? How do we respond to the
dissonance produced by overlapping layers of conflicted histories,
including the ambivalent history of multiculturalism?
On October 16, 2010, the public was invited to participate in this
performance by riding their bicycles alongside Khang’s pedal-powered
mini-tank all the way to Montréal City Hall. While wearing military
fatigues, Khang recited the notable public enunciations from forty years
ago, spliced together in three languages. Using a paintball gun, a symbolic
execution of Pierre Laporte was carried out with the help of willing
members of the public. [BIO]David Khang is a visual, performance, and
biological artist whose practice is informed by education in psychology,
theology, dentistry, and law. Khang selectively imbeds these disciplinary
codes into his work, to compose interdisciplinary languages that
materialize in visual, textual, and spoken forms. In performing, Khang
often embodies these languages to interrogate social constructions – of
gender, race, and interspecies relations – that are present within
dominant historic narratives in contemporary culture. By strategically
employing non-native languages and code switching, Khang produces
divergent, dissonant, and often hyperbolic and humorous readings that
re-imagine the poetic and the political.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY] In El Tanquetazo de Mariposa (2015), David Khang contrasts the
machinery and dressings of warfare with butterfly imagery. A soldier begins
playing his viola. Next, a poem is read in Spanish, French, and Korean. The
poem implores the listening audience to open themselves, to experience the
transformative act of opening—opening one's eyes, one's ears, and one's
heart to the surrounding world and to others. Employing the chryalis as a
metaphor, Khang finishes reading, removes his camaflouge fatigues and
uncovers the military tank in the background to reveal a butterfly soldier
and vehicle. The tank––with a tricycle inside––is maneuveured
through the gallery space. The audience is saluted and thanked. The titular
tanquetazo references a 1973 failed coup against Chilean president Salvador
Allende. [BIO]David Khang is a visual, performance, and biological artist

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]In this performance, Khang walked 80 kilometers, or 50 miles, along
the Pacific Coast Highway in California—from Irvine to Los Angeles. The
performance took 22 hours to complete, traversing a distance that is
approximately a one-hour drive. Set against the normative Southern
Californian architecture defined by freeways and vehicles, this act of
walking, at once absurd and impractical, becomes a conscious gesture that
works to reclaim and reinscribe this space with a real body-in-motion. The
performance concluded as Khang reached Los Angeles in time for the opening
reception at Track 16 Gallery in nearby Santa Monica.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (520):
    [SUMMARY]Bleeding Book / Línea Lingua (2004) is a three-channel video
installation. One channel sits behind a reflective ink pool, the ink images
on screen mirroring and diverging with the pool's surface. The other
channels show footage of Khang as he creates a calligraphy on the canvas
and in the space. Drawing either a circle or a straight line, in both
videos he employs his naked form and a cow's tongue dipped in motor oil as corporeal writing instruments. This performance was part of the
artist's graduate thesis project at the University of California Irvine.
