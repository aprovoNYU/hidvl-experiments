Rehearsal was interrupted by authorities that peacefully requested that the group leave the stage location. Camera follows the group of actors and the director onto the street appearing to be unintentionally recording the activities with few prolonged and established shots. The camera obscurely captures this live occurrence of their removal and new found location in a prison yard policed by armed men --friendly banter between the actors and police, large vehicles move in and out of the yard, footage of chained barred fence with groups of uniformed and armed police milling about on both sides as actors board a bus that pulls up inside the yard. Camera follows the group of actors and director from the prison yard by bus to the Camarín del Carmen theater and through pre-show warm-ups, ensemble and personal interviews with the actors. The production is staged in the context of the International Human Rights Day. The play begins 3/4 through the tape. Under a large spotlight on a sparse stage with rope, wire and flowers hanging from the ceiling, the play experiments with the representation of an enclosed space. The project demonstrates the work of the actors' imagination of both mental and physical space as they enact their role through movements, gestures and the manipulation of objects. The video ends approximately 15 minutes into the performance. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org <http://www.mapateatro.org> ) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor.

The story metaphorically unravels as an intercultural, theatrical and human experience: a man from another world appears one day, fallen from the sky into the backyard of Pelayo, a villager and his wife, Elisenda. The production is, for bothcompanies, an experience of alterity and difference, where an experimental theater from the 'new continent' searches in the traditions of popular theater from the 'thousand-year-old continent,' looking for thriving ritual forms and a 'total language' capable of illuminating the dark paths of contemporary theater, while the ancient epic art of Theru Koothu discovers, in the work of a contemporary playwright and in the gaze of Mapa Teatro's theater, the possibility of exploring new horizons and revitalizing its own tradition. According to Mapa Teatro, the experience revealed 'a post-dramatic theatrical form approaching pre-dramatic forms and vice-versa, creating a dialogue between past and present over the space of the performance itself.' Approx. first 20 min. of this video documentation is dedicated to backstage pre-performance activities, following various actors through parts of their preparation routine in drinking coffee, applying make-up and sitting about a large room together. A brief interview with Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro contextualizes their working relationship, while actors sit behind them applying make-up in the background. The video concludes with two fragments of the performance recorded by two different cameras.","Mapa Teatro|Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Theru Kothu Manram (Tamil Nadu)|Garcí́a Márquez, Gabriel, 1928- Señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes|Theater|Columbia|India|Theru Koothu","Mapa Teatro Laboratorio de Artistas",,"Under Performance Genre & under Topical Subject Keywords appears 'Theru Koothu,' which is a form of rural folk theater from the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu.Under Keywords, the names 'Mapa Teatro' and 'Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Theru Kothu Manram (Tamil Nadu)' are two theater ensembles, so they should appear, I guess, as"

Lozano’s workinvestigates how the body is constructed and conceptualized withininstitutions of state control. The alternate title for this performance,'12 Physical-Rhytmical Exercises of the Americas, without Weapons,'proposes compelling questions about the construction of the physical andthe political body, always fluctuating between the individualistic and thesocial, and resisting or assimilating institutional conventions. The factthat performance was presented at the entrance of the Universidad Nacionalde Bogotá also implies a reflection about the autonomy of this institutionin relation to other organisms of control.

In thiscontroversial piece, Bruguera brought together a panel of Colombian peoplewho had been directly affected by their country's national conflict arounddrugs, to discuss their concerns and share their diverging points of view.Unbeknownst to them, the audience, and the curators of the event, Bruguerahad arranged for a tray of cocaine to be circulated throughout the space.As the cocaine was freely offered by a kind of cocaine 'server,' focusquickly shifted from the panel to the audience. Some were confused, somewere outraged, others engaged in drug use. All of this complicated theissues addressed by the panel speakers—the Colombian war on drugs andthose who suffer its consequences—creating a clash between the victims ofthe conflict and the very drug that is ostensibly at the center of thatconflict. Tania Bruguera is a political artist who works primarily in'behavior art' (arte de conducta). Her work explores the role of theaudience in performances, and the relationship between ethics and desire.In 2002 she created the Cátedra Arte de Conducta, the first center inHavana dedicated to the study of political art.","please, change|Performance art--Political aspects|Performance art--Latin America|War on drugs|Victims of violence--Colombia||HI Episode Submission:","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

Viveca Vázquez is a choreographer,dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dance for actors atthe University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first work with Pisotón,the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and, shortly after,Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director. Through thecompany she presented her choreographic work and produced events such as‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of the experimentaldance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which was co-produced withPuerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto. Since 1984 shehas produced and performed experimental dance works in the United States,Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number of other places. As ateacher she has developed a pedagogical model based on body conscience andimprovisation. ‘Tour de fuerza’ was a project conceived and directed bythe end of the 1980s by Dance Theater Workshop’s executive director DavidWhite. The project included works by choreographers, filmmakers, perfomers,visual artists, etc. This video presents Viveca Vázquez’ participationin the project, which includes three pieces: The first one, ‘Mascandoinglés’ (Chewing English), is an experimental dance choreography thatworks with the body in the context of the Puerto Rico-U.S. migration andthe linguistic displacement that this migration generates. Theperformers’ bodies oscillate between orientation and disorientation,rhythmic movements and dislocation, sound and silence. These bodies areboth linguistically and physically displaced. However, ‘Mascandoinglés’ explores the ways in which the language of the body could entailother forms of communication. The second piece, ‘Entendido’(Under-stood), offers a choreography that intends to be synchronized;however, the most important part of this movement is each individual bodyand its particularities, given that dialogue implies assuming differences.The political content is highlighted by the presence of Puerto Rican andAmerican flags -- a symbol that positions the body between balance andunbalance, and a power that forces a disciplined body to obey several rulesat the same time, but also impulses that body to subvert them. The thirdpiece, ‘Las fumadoras’ (The Smokers), presents feminine bodies andtheir relationship between themselves and with various objects. The pieceoffers a sensation of intimacy and sharing, but also disappearance,silence, and darkness. By the minute the bodies are hardly visible, andonly their movements reaffirm that they are a live presence. Thisphysicality is finally accompanied by singing voices, which gives a glimpseof a possible sisterhood and freedom.","Emigration and immigration|Puerto Rico -- Emigration and immigration -- United States|Performance and politics|Body politics|Movement (acting)","Viveca Vázquez",,

The piece questionspre-conceptions of what a feminine body is and how it moves, and in doingthis it offers a rethinking of gender identities. Both bodies are incontact but disconnected at the same time, functioning as support andimpulse to each other; this dialogue and counterpoint is continuous, giventhat while a body expands, the other contracts. This game betweenconnection and disconnection mirrors a dislocation between movement, sound,and silence. In this manner, the performance presents bodies-in-between,which reassure their existence and their political significance onlythrough a shared corporeality and collaborative movement.","Puerto Rico -- Emigration and immigration -- United States|Choreographers--United States|Collaborative creation|Experimental dance|Dance and society","Viveca Vázquez and Sally Silvers",,

Viveca Vázquez is achoreographer, dancer, and a professor of humanities and contemporary dancefor actors at the University of Puerto Rico. She presented her first workwith Pisotón, the first experimental dance group of Puerto Rico and,shortly after, Taller de Otra Cosa, of which she became the first director.Through the company she presented her choreographic work and producedevents such as ‘Rompeforma’ a key festival in the development of theexperimental dance and performance scene in Puerto Rico, which wasco-produced with Puerto Rican choreographer based in the U.S. Merian Soto.Since 1984 she has produced and performed experimental dance works in theUnited States, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, among a great number ofother places. As a teacher she has developed a pedagogical model based onbody conscience and improvisation. ‘Malajuste’ is a Taller de OtraCosa’s proposal, created as a collective collaboration with a group ofyoung people to work on dance, and to develop a space of co-creation,exploration, and study. This performance includes four pieces: The firstone, ‘Mast-urbana,’ plays with sexuality topics, and gender roles, in asociety marked by taboo. The video insert explores topics such assexuality, religion, masturbation, and guilt, and the relationship with theown body; the presence of this video also points out the role of visualityin our body self-perception. The second piece, ‘Mira y qué’ questionspre-concepts of what a masculine body might be, and subverts therelationship between the masculine and the feminine. The feminine‘voice’ is also questioned through the resource of lip-synching. Thethird piece, ‘Nacedós’ contrasts quotidian movement vs. veryoppressive sound. In this manner, the piece proposes one of the mainconcerns of this performance: how to ‘adjust’? How does the language ofthe body adjust to external inputs, like sound; and also to ‘constructed’inputs, like gender roles, or visuality? Finally, the last piece,‘Vieques no es un pescao’ is dedicated to Vieques Island and PuertoRico, and their resistance against army tests by the US military. Thisisland is referred as a zone of disaster; however, the question about whichforce is more harmful, the natural forces or the human forces -- with theirpolitical and economical greed -- remains open. With this last part, theidea of “adjustment” involves a political turn and a component ofsocial concern that includes Puerto Rico in the reflection presented onstage.","Puerto Rico -- Emigration and immigration -- United States|Performance and politics|Gender politics|Experimental theatre – dance|Vieques Island (P.R.)--Politics and government","Viveca Vázquez",,

These bodies are literally moving in the edge,verging on the unbalance; in this manner, horror seems to be more a stateof the body that a state of mind. The stage is divided based on thedifferent rooms that a house can contain -- in this manner, thisperformance is related to the space as a concept, and to an exploration ofmemory, fear, and being afraid of fear. ‘¡Uy!’ proposes severalquestions: What is that which scares us?

The reverberation of voices and movement resemblesthe idea of plagiarism (‘plagio’), which in this case is understood asa re-enactment and re-creation of the classics. This video documentary isdescribed as a ‘Piece of dance-theater inspired in Augustine of Hippo.’The implications of bringing Saint Augustine to the University of PuertoRico engage this performance with contemporary concerns, related to thediscussion on colonialism and post-colonialism.

Circa29 BC, Virgil was the best poet in the city and Augustus was victoriousafter a long war period. Augustus entrusted Virgil to write the poem of hisglory. Three books are central in the this epic poem, IV and V, where thenarration presents the love between Dido, Queen of Carthage and Aeneas; andbook VI, where Aeneas goes to the Avernus to meet his father Anquises’shadow. mAroma adapts these books and adds a new viewpoint by using PierPaolo Pasolini’s Mamma Roma. As Mara Negrón points out in the playbillfor the staging of this piece in March and April 2006, ‘mAroma navigatesthrough the fragments of these stories without intending a lineal narrationof the episodes. The characters circulate in a city without and identity --it can be any city, any street in the world. Rome is not Rome, but a placeof transit, riddled with encounters and misunderstandings, where thecharacters visit their own desires’ shadows, where the characters turnsomersaults (‘hacen maromas’) in-between their past and their present.And at the same time, Rome is always Rome -- a place inhabited by its past.The characters of mAroma are yesterday and are today.’ In giving bodiesto these characters, the performers insert themselves in the continuousdialogue between history and present, and the embodiment of thatrelationship on stage.","Stage adaptations--Puerto Rico|Arts and History-- Rome|Experimental dance -- theatre|Body politics-- History| |||HI Episode Submission:","Viveca Vázquez",,

She islinked through memory, history, and feminist statements with hercontemporary counterpart, Jesusa Rodríguez, who memorized the almost 1,000verses of the poem as a part of a creative process that allowed her notonly to develop a profound interpretation of its contents, but also a fullybodily internalization experience. This intense relationship with the poemhelped her to survive in the everyday world, to strengthen her politicalstruggle, and to fight oblivion. For Jesusa Rodríguez, Sor Juana’spoetry is both a-temporal and contemporary, and a source of inspiration andwisdom to keep working on acts of resistance. As a tribute, JesusaRodríguez uses theater to transmit the greatest poem of one of thegreatest Mexican poets, and to make it visible and accessible to everyone.Diverse stage elements serve as tools to reveal specific parts of the poem,through a ‘striptease,’ or an autopsy that helps to understand thebeauty of Sor Juana’s words.[BIO] Jesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret andpolitical performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Oftenreferred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly andwith vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Herwork challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease genericboundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret;from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, toperformative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábitoin Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundredsof shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up theResistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.","Juana Inés de la Cruz, Sister, 1651-1695.

She considers that cabaret provides improvisation as a trainingtool to exercise negotiation and risk. Also, the immediate response of theaudience transforms the artist into a medium that conveys what the publicfeels and thinks; in this sense, cabaret is a space both to become aware ofthe current political situation and to foresee what could be upcoming,which engenders a more participative audience. Jesusa Rodríguez and herResistencia Creativa movement organized a massive ‘plantón’ (sit-in)in Mexico City’s Zócalo (main square) to protest against thecontroversial results of the Presidential Elections in 2006. She broughttogether different groups and art expressions from a wide range of Mexicancitizens and collaborators, and they presented different spectacles everyday during this 40-days sit-in. This demonstration was an example of theart’s role in the struggle for a country’s transformation as well as anact of generosity and solidarity. Based on her ‘artivist’ experiences,Jesusa Rodríguez asks: how art and resistance transform and energize thepeople little by little every day?[BIO] Jesusa Rodríguez is Mexico’s most influential cabaret andpolitical performance artist, and recipient of an Obie Award. Oftenreferred to as a chameleon, Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly andwith vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Herwork challenges traditional classification, crossing with ease genericboundaries: from elite to popular to mass; from Greek tragedy to cabaret;from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera; from revue, sketch and carpa, toperformative acts within political projects. She ran the famous El Hábitoin Mexico City with her partner, Liliana Felipe, where they staged hundredsof shows over the course of fifteen years. Most recently, she heads up theResistencia Creativa movement in Mexico, whose key strategy is using‘massive cabaret’ as a tool for political action.","Mexico--history--21st century|Theater and society|Electoral politics|Political activists|Political participation -- Mexico","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

AstridHadad, Liliana Felipe, and Eugenia León performed both individually andtogether, in a show organized and directed by Jesusa Rodríguez. Thepresence of these women in Central Park, singing in Spanish, speaks aboutthe intertwined relationship between the local and the transnational, aswell as the interest in Latin American and Latino/a culture in New YorkCity. The political strength of this performance comes from the voices, thebodies, and the words of these amazing women. This video documentationincludes mostly Astrid Hadad’s participation in the show, as well as agrand finale where she and Liliana Felipe and Eugenia León delight theaudience with smart and fun rancheras.[BIOS] Astrid Hadad is a singer and actress, graduated from Mexico City'sCentro Universitario de Teatro. She looks to cabaret and performance torepresent social, cultural, and political crisis in Mexico and, at the sametime, to entertain. Costumed in her signature wearable art, Hadad blendspopular songs and ranchero, son and bolero music and political satire withhighly theatrical precision to create a genre of music she calls 'HeavyNopal'. Her work takes on the stereotypes of Mexican culture and reframesthem to comment on the forms of machismo in a variety of local and globalcontexts. Eugenia León is a singer born in Mexico, defined as a singercommitted to the people and their causes. She has performed all around theworld and her repertoire includes diverse genres, such as tango, bolero,norteño, Latin American music and rancheras. The strength and versatilityof her voice makes her one of the most beloved and recognized Mexicansingers. Liliana Felipe is a composer, singer, actor, tango musician, andclergyphobe. She left Argentina for Mexico just before the military coup in1976, but her sister and brother-in-law remain among the 30,000disappeared. She and her partner, Jesusa Rodríguez, owned and operated ElHabito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in MexicoCity. Jesusa Rodríguez is a Mexican director, actress, playwright,performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur and social activist, who hasbeen called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ‘espectáculos’ (asboth spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossingwith ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greektragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue,sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects.","Mexico -- Intellectual life|Women singers--Mexico|Women singers--Argentina","Astrid Hadad",,

Lozano’s performance work explores the relational linksbetween bodies, proposing powerful ways for evidencing and undoing embodiedconstructions of gender and citizenship. Considering performance as a sitefor surprise, and for the non-controlled, his work ‘Marca y ego: Oficiospara el cuerpo’ offers a reflection upon how bodies are marked as‘abjected,’ and how those bodies’ textures are a surface thattransmits meaning. Although the body is a vulnerable territory, it also canfunction as a means to subvert preconceptions about the body, within thebody, and from the body.

It’s a story of courage and boldness, perseverance andtenaciousness in ones convictions, and the coherence of socialist idealsthroughout a generous and combative life, end to end.

The memories of ex-slaves recordedin interviews in the 1930’s constitute the raw material of this theaterpiece. The lines and dialogue of this play are the words of black men andwomen in their eighties and nineties, who remember their experience of the‘peculiar institution’ as it happened to them nearly a lifetime ago.Characters in the play adopt different personalities, telling thestories/histories of other slaves’ experiences, and expressing theoppressions of serving in the military, inter-racial relationships, and theblack/white social power dynamic. Among these horrors, faith sustained themand infused their desire for survival, always holding the promise that inthe future they will be free: ‘On my way to heaven, Lord remember me …do Lord, do Lord, do Lord remember me.’","Slaves--Abuse of--United States|Collective memory|Identity politics","University of Massachusetts Amherst",,

Even more,whiteness as a counterpart of black identity is brought as a desired spacefor hiding the skin color that is related to negativity, and ‘dreaming ofa white life.’ Playing with irony, and acknowledging that the fearsembedded in centuries of a history of oppression are not easy to dissolve,the characters engage within a game show scenario that announces thewinners of the whitest black person – a gesture that moves betweensarcasm and despair.","Race relations--Multiculturalism|Blacks--Race identity","University of Massachusetts Amherst",,

This interview isfocused on the production, organization, theoretical conceptualization, andthe experience of the project ‘Witness to the Ruins,’ created by MapaTeatro in collaboration with former inhabitants of the neighborhood SantaInés del Cartucho, Bogotá. The conversation discusses the notion of‘archive’ propelled by this project, which has become a mobile memoryfor the city. Mapa Teatro’s work subverts and questions the inflexiblecoherence that an archive usually imposes to memory. During thegentrification process of Bogotá, El Cartucho’s human side was forgottenunder the idea of urban progress; Mapa Teatro’s work intends to recoverthe memories of the citizens evicted from their neighborhood, emphasizingthe role of the body as the space where remembering and forgetting become apresent experience. In this way, body and presence remove themselves fromthe archive, and become the living voice of memory.","Theater--Colombia--Bogotá|Theater and society-Colombia-Bogotá|Abderhalden, Heidi--Interviews|Abderhalden, Rolf--Interviews","Mapa Teatro Laboratorio de Artistas",,

Theentire experience was possible because of the bonds established with theinhabitants of the neighborhood as well as the interest in creating amoving memorial monument against ‘the architecture of the emptiness.’After presenting the fourth project, Rolf and Heidi sit down just towitness the last archive images displaying news about the new spaces thatEl Cartucho’s people are trying to occupy and the empty park built on theterritory where the neighborhood was. In a constant reactivation of thearchive, they insert themselves in the process of remembering what they donot want to forget: the living memory of human beings that cannot beerased. Q&A and comments by Diana Taylor and Andreas Huyssen accompany thisperformance/lecture.","Theater--Colombia--Bogotá|Gentrification-Colombia-Bogotá|El Cartucho (Bogotá, Colombia)|Abderhalden, Rolf -- Conference|Abderhalden, Heidi -- Conference|Memoria & sociedad -- Bogota -- Colombia","Mapa Teatro Laboratorio de Artistas",,

[SUMMARY] This is a video documentation of one of the first events created by Project 2050, ‘More Than One Prison,’ where young performers discuss the relationships between youth of color and the prison industrial complex. Performers integrate movement and rhyme, stomp style, to discuss the politics of prisons. They reflect upon prison as an omnipresent institution that affects individual lives, making people social prisoners. If imprisonment pervades so many aspects of life, then they ask: ‘how do you know you are free?’ Through spoken word and verses created by them, these young performers share with the audience their thoughts about what means being a woman, being a person of color, and being marginalized in a society that lacks opportunities. They make clear that incarceration is not the only way of being in prison, and that social change is necessary to be free of both symbolic and violent forms of oppression.","Politics of race and ethnicity|Prison industries|Performing arts and youth","University of Massachusetts Amherst c/o Dennis F.

As a collaborative creation, these stories can be read not only like personal stories, but also as the stories of a community. Alberto Antonio Araiza, Paul Bonin-Rodriguez, and Michael Marínez worked together in community-based activism, and create a multi-disciplinary performance piece that involves storytelling, ritual, performance and visual arts. For this reason, ‘Quinceañera’ transits between the cheerfulness of a creative process and the engagement with a topic that is full of fear and sorrow. The ghost of AIDS permeates relations between persons and their own traditions, stories, and histories. Particularly, the social ritual of the ‘quinceañera’ – the debutante party reserved for young girls in Spanish-speaking communities – becomes a space of contesting gender and sexuality roles. At the same time that the piece reveals how rituals are gendered, it also highlights how affective responses to pop culture can be understood as newer familiar traditions. The role of Spanish language, unapologetically spoken in the piece, underlines the fact that gender, ethnicity, and race are intertwined in social marginalization. Along with an honest and strong affirmation of race and sexuality, the virus that marks the body signals identity and belonging. The three male characters explain how AIDS affected gay population, and the discrimination that comes with the epidemic. The group of men breaks into songs advocating for justice for all people infected with AIDS, and the entire queer community. The video documentation also features a talk back with the performers and the audience members.

[SUMMARY] This video documentation features Project 2050, giving a detailed explanation of this initiative’s goals. Roberta Uno, founder and artistic director of New WORLD Theater briefly describes the reach of the project, and explains the metaphor – and demographic projection – that in year 2050 people of color will out number white people. The video presents teachers from the program, discussing the future of art, race, and aesthetics. Also, the video showcases artistic works created by youth artists involved with Project 2050.  In the summer of 2001, these pieces explored identity politics, immigration, incarceration, exploitation, negotiation, and identification as main topics addressed through artistic and activist work. Young performers and their mentors interpellate industrial projects and community survival, discrimination, solidarity, and heritage narratives.  The vitality of the youth art program is felt through student testimonials and it is further related to the necessity to make such program accessible in public schools. As it is highlighted in the credits, all students, artists and scholars, counselors, and staff involved in the project worked together to reach ‘year 2001 and counting….’","Performing arts and youth|Performing arts -- Social justice|Youth -- Political participation -- Performing arts","University of Massachusetts Amherst c/o Dennis F.

She gives an account of New WORLD Theater’s historical trajectory, highlighting the fact that working with young performers from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds require both a critical and committed perspective. Following the mission of providing a multi-cultural space and stage for artists of color, and contrary to the idea of a ‘melting pot,’ she proposes to show the individualities of each tradition, and look for productive dialogues from a comparative approach, which acknowledges and respects similarities and differences. Uno also underlines the importance of funding the theater space through allies in the community and their support to generate a space for cultural diverse work – a work that can only be developed collaboratively.  Uno extends this dialogue into the process of reaching out to the local theater community and working directly with individuals to create performance works that defy cultural biases that a traditional framework may impose upon artists of color. In 1991, New WORLD Theater was in itself a big achievement, being ahead of its time as a cultural institution. By the second decade of the 21st century, it is possible not only to see the development of a visionary project, but also to understand Roberta Uno’s awareness of archiving artistic pieces, and to organize them by topics so that they can be accessible for researchers and artists.[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics.

Difference in opportunities based on class, spread violence, the AIDS pandemic, racism, amongst other social and political issues, are embodied on stage and transmitted as concrete realities. The performers intertwine these issues to their own lives through narrative, gesture and song, building little pieces of a social fabric – and addressing a society where they are looking for their own place. From this very personal point of view, they critically evaluate how the world is in the present, and what they expect, fear, and hope for the future","Performing arts and youth|Performing arts -- Social justice|Youth -- Political participation -- Performing arts","University of Massachusetts Amherst c/o Dennis F.

[SUMMARY] In ‘Umoja,’ young members from Project 2050 perform monologues exploring social issues ranging from immigration to women’s liberation. The use of different languages bring together their roots and their future, placing them in-between tradition and futurity. Diverse stories travel from individualities to the history of entire communities: One young performer reflects on her experience as a Vietnamese immigrant pursuing the ‘American Dream.’ Another young performer discusses his inter-racial identity from a Colombian perspective.  Another young performer states her views about feminism from a ‘dark girl’s perspective.’ Among all these different struggles and dreams, there are points of contact and similarities that set the ground for a better future. Thus, the performance ends with the performers collectively dancing and chanting harmoniously in their diversity.","Performing arts and youth|Performing arts -- Social justice|Youth -- Political participation -- Performing arts","University of Massachusetts Amherst c/o Dennis F.

[SUMMARY] In ‘Ashy Ankles,’ Project 2050’s young performers explore oppressive statements around race and gender that they have experienced as young women of color. This oppression is clearly structural when discrimination comes from the ones who must take care of youth and must empower students: the teachers. Repeating the line ‘lies my teacher told me’ with vigorous sound and noise, the young performers on stage materialize the contradictions and isolation they confronted within an education system intended to replicate the same spiral of abuse and discrimination that pervades society. The young women weave chorus song and wording with quickstep movement, thus being empowered by their bodies and voices. They re-appropriate the oppressive statements and affirm their identities from their own viewpoints as women of color, and unveil their teachers’ oppressive gesture claiming that ‘they lied.’ The piece ends with the young women stating ‘they lied’ to point out the false truth of the oppressive statements projected onto them, and defying any pretended determination of their future, showing themselves as creative and strong human beings. By inviting the audience with the statement ‘look at me know,’ they demonstrate that social change is possible from and through each empowered individual.","Performing arts and youth|Performing arts -- Social justice|Youth -- Political participation -- Performing arts","University of Massachusetts Amherst c/o Dennis F.

The piece is a reflection upon relationships with a tradition and racial and ethnic backgrounds as the legacy inherited from ancestors, and what would be given, in turn, to future generations born in the wake of diasporic and migration movements. ‘Chicomoztoc/Mimixcoa--Cloud Serpents,’ by Elvira Colorado and Hortencia Colorado, from Coatlicue Theater Company, is a work-in-progress that discusses the metaphorical relationship between railroad tracks and a family history marked by migration. ‘Las Colorado’ explain the piece as being ‘a journey through dreams, stories, time and memory, across mountains and deserts, retracing the footsteps of the ancestors, traveling back to Chicomoztoc (the place of our origin), searching, digging up and gathering stories that have been buried through centuries of shame and denial in our family, but which connect us to our past and identity. Some stories/secrets remain buried, and they are also part of who we are.’ ‘The Return of Elijah, The African,’ by Sekou Sundiata, interweaves spoken word with jazz singers and band. Music and poetry recount together the origins of slavery, as well as the evils of master-slave dynamics of oppression. ‘New Works For a New World’ constitutes a complex canvas that encompasses the power of diverse languages: the language of the body, the language in translation, the language of music, and the transformative sound of meaningful voices.   [BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics. From a geographic ‘outpost’ in New England, New WORLD Theater evolved from a community organizing project and the Northeast point on a theater touring compass, to a protective studio to hone new work, a site of international intersections from South Africa to the South Bronx, and the home of inspired and rigorous collaborations with Western Massachusetts youth. New performance work development at New WORLD defied the conventional theater play lab as ghetto for artists of color; artists were met where they wanted to be in the imagining of new approaches, methods, and production.","Asian American art -- performing arts --political aspects|Indigenous women -- performing arts -- political aspects|African American art -- performing arts -- political aspects","University of Massachusetts Amherst c/o Dennis F.

The event brought together artists, intellectuals, theater producers, arts presenters, and arts activists to explore the process, evolution, and dynamics of making theater in the dawning moments of the 21st century. One of the featured performances was ‘Antígona,’ directed by Miguel Rubio Zapata and masterfully performed by Teresa Ralli, founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (Peru). This one-woman performance of José Watanabe’s version of Sophocles classic tragedy is a breathtaking example of the devastation caused by twenty years of civil violence in Peru. Although this is the story of only one character, it speaks for the nearly 70,000 disappeared men, women and children of Peru, and for the thousands of survivors who are still fighting for their right to mourn their loved ones.

Yuyachkani is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering;’ under this name, the theater group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. Their work has been among the most important in Latin Americas so called New Popular Theatre, with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.[BIO] From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ‘new world’—one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America’s shifting demographics.

It recounts the testimony of an indigenous survivor of the 1986 massacre at Soccos, in Ayacucho. Coya and her sister, Huaco, along with their father, are in the midst of colliding forces that destroy everything in the peasant village in the middle of the Andes where they live. The scenes of devastation correspond to the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Army that left civilians with no options for survival. The symbolic seeds of life would represent an option to preserve life, at the expense of the death of the peasants. Masked dancers and archangels fight for ownership of the peasants’ souls in the ‘danza de la diablada’ or Devil dance from the Fiesta de la Candelaria in Puno. After their death, the seeds of life are left by the peasants in the ground, and into the hands of the Ekeko, a constant figure on stage, who performs as witness of the story, and who will transmit both the seeds of life and the narration: ‘these seeds were given to me by a woman, who told me a story.’ The music, images, and voices bring Peruvian traditions to the stage, and at the same time reveal the miscommunications between those who hold power to exert either violence or justice, and the peasants who demand to be taking into account. The difficulties that they have to confront also encompass their constant efforts for survival – as Ekeko affirms: ‘the condor learnt to fly against the wind; now you have to follow him.’[BIO] Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation.

Yuyachkani’s piece ‘Allpa Rayku’ marks the group’s quest for Peruvian deep traditions and the Andean world, as well as Correa’s own identity and connections with her own indigenous roots. Traveling throughout Peru, the group found diverse sources of inspiration for the ‘cholificación’ of their proposal – an aesthetic and political project that encompassed Peruvian local spheres within larger global concerns. The group’s members’ training, and their deep investigation and experience as actors, is intertwined with a self-reflection as a group. Their performances provide a space for marginalized civilians to speak and to be heard, and present the violence suffered by the country in the crossfire between terrorist group ‘Sendero Luminoso’ and the Peruvian Government and Army. The country was devastated by this violence, and sunk in an internal void and fragility. Yuyachkani worked with this, convinced that theater make us better human beings. Correa explains how Yuyachkani actors are companions for the character, who is always in the foreground, and how the group has worked in coordination with popular organizations, NGOs, and communities. She highlights the role of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics’ international events and Encuentros, a space that brings a necessary aperture – a space to sit down together and try to understand each other.[BIO] Peru’s most important theater collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation.

The main character, Sumita, leaves India for the United States to marry a man she has never met before, and she expresses her anxieties about being exiled from her family. The struggles to adapt to U.S. American culture are symbolically transferred to clothes’ shapes and colors, since Sumita has to trade in her native ‘sari’ for t-shirts and jeans. When Sumita’s husband dies, she is left to choose the life of an independent woman in the United States or return to her in-laws in India. Now a ‘widow in a white sari,’ Sumita vows to stay in the United States despite not knowing how she will survive. Through dance and music that intertwines delicate movements with a subtle but strong body, storytelling transmits the complexity of a female identity that moves between tradition and modernity. The characters’ gestures, and the music, dance, and percussion through the play, reveal a story that is part of a broader history of cultural encounters. [BIO] Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is an award-winning author, poet, activist and teacher. Her themes include the Indian experience, contemporary U.S. America, women, immigration, history, myth, and the joys and challenges of living in a multi-cultural world. Her books have been translated into 29 languages, and her work has appeared in over a hundred magazines and anthologies. Several of her novels and stories have been made into films and plays. She has won an American Book Award and a Light of India award.

During the several years of their existence, they have created a personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both on the stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school, offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribal organization is based on the principle of collective work, both in the creative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality, and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledge and to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a world marked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing and barbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounce injustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing of memory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service of arts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethics and aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehicle for ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part in it.[SYNOPSIS] This staging of Genet's The Maids focuses on the relationships of exploitation and subservience that inform the class differences between the two maids and their rich mistress. The production emphasizes the theme of a feminine universe subjugated to an essentially macho society by having the female characters be played by men. The set—chairs for the audience, a double bed, a wardrobe, and a dresser with a mirror—is decorated with flowers, satin drapes, an altar for a saint that stands for the mistress, and a large painting of a phallus. The staging takes place as a mystic-erotic ceremony, and the entire configuration of the furniture is phallic. In the role playing games the maids play, the ambiguities in their relationship to their mistress become obvious. They are connected to her image by affection, erotism, and hatred, while they nurture a deep feeling of contempt for each other, since they see in each other what they really are. Their greatest desire is not to eliminate the class to which their mistress belongs, but rather to occupy her place in society.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Genet, Jean, 1910-1986.

There is a silent and desperate pact between them, where Hamm is the despot who gives the orders which Clov obeys, but it is Clov who determines if the game goes on or not, since he could leave at any time and the others would die. The whole story revolves around the fear that he may leave, but he doesn't, because there is nowhere to go. Even in the end, when he ceases to answer the request of the blind Hamm, Clov stands by his side, still and silent, with a suitcase in hand. Everything ends as it began, and nothing happens.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Beckett, Samuel, 1906-1989.

Once the last audience member enters, the doctor locks the door behind them. The performance takes place in this closed room, fragments from the life of a women tormented by mental illness. Her schizophrenia is portrayed not as a clinical disease, but as an inevitable consequence of the process of social adaptation we are all submitted to since childhood. In search for her identity, she seeks complicity from the audience, while all sorts of strange and violent things happen to her and to the room, without one word being said.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil;","Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz",,

The story of the merchant and the porter who get lost in the desert is complemented by a chorus of seven performers, who sing the events using Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and a body of eleven performers that personifies the geography, the animals, and the feelings of the story.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Street theater -- Brazil; Brecht, Bertolt, 1898-1956.

The entire story of Faust is staged, but not the whole text nor all the scenes. Instead, the audience of 30 people is guided through a succession of dreamlike environments, in a journey towards the unconscious of the character. Ói Nóis' Faust brings up the question of who is, after all, the Faustian man of our time: Is it the scientist and the politician, or the outsider, the one who contests the system? This story reveals to the audience two essential factors for human emancipation: the desire for knowledge and the pleasure principal, both crucial for fighting power and fueling revolutions.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

The purpose is to demystify the so-called 'heroes,' and to put the true workforce and culture of this country into its rightful place. The invasion of the land of the Native Americans and the expatriation and enslavement of African peoples serve as a narrative structure, exemplifying the oppression and poverty in which the majority of the Brazilians still live. The light-hearted and ironic tone with which the official 'heroes' are treated brings some air to the moldy way the history of this country has been told, praising the name of a few while neglecting the rest.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Street theater -- Brazil;","Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz",,

Helped by her friend Santinha, Matilda needs to go through several obstacles to overcome the sanitary rules of the United States embassy, which bar the people of Pindaíba from imigrating. Free from amoebas and bacteria, our hero transforms her fecal matter in a symbol for Brazilian clean feces, creating the possibility of becoming rich selling feces to all those people who also dream with the pleasures of the 'American way of life.' Registering Brazil’s social situation through allegory and farce, the clown characters are an expression of Brazil’s popular theatre, establishing a connection with the people in the streets. The humor and playfulness hide a strong critical power.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Street theater -- Brazil; Boal, Augusto","Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz",,

His texts are formed of fragments, shattered scenes, and derisory monologues, stimuli for the creative invention of a performed reality, the only reality capable of transgressively translating the complexity of contemporary existence. In one of the final scenes in Ói Nóis' adaptation, the dead figure of Stalin appears in the TV monitors, while three naked actresses parade wearing giant heads of Marx, Lenin and Mao. The characters and scenes are pulverized and multifaceted, allowing for distinct and contradictory readings, which provide for countless concrete political interpretations and symbolic references.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul); Theater--Political aspects--Brazil; Müller, Heiner, 1929-1995.

Directed by Santiago García, La Candelaria is one of Colombian theater's most innovative agents, modernizing national drama while addressing popular audiences. By means of an ongoing exploration of national folklore, situations and characters, they have created some of Colombia's most compelling plays, some of them through the method of 'creación colectiva' ('collective creation'), addressing the acute social and political problems of their society. At the same time, they fostered the creation of Corporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number of theoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods and languages. Still nowadays, La Candelaria is committed to repertoire, experimentation, and discussion as fundamental elements to artistic creation. [SYNOPSIS] Nayra is collective creation of La Candelaria that explores the unconscious and the popular worldview about health, death, and displacement. ‘Nayra’ is an Aymara word that means ‘eye,’ but can also mean ‘ancestors,’ ‘memory’ and ‘vision.’ Director Santiago García describes the piece as ‘an exploration of our myths and legends as both Colombians and Latin Americans.’ This piece enacts a time/space of assemblages that address the quest for connections more than the connections per se. By the end of the piece, mirrors blow to pieces, thus recalling not only a fragmented shared memory, but also a country crushed by violence.","Theater--Colombia; Creación colectiva; Political violence—Colombia; Memory--social aspects--Latin America","Teatro La Candelaria",,

(Hijos e Hijas por la Identidad y la Justicia contra el Olvido y el Silencio) is a national and international organization founded in 1995 by the sons and daughters of disappeared persons during the dictatorship in Argentina. Their objective is to continue their parents’ social struggles, find young people kidnapped by the military, and fight against impunity. The members of H.I.J.O.S. are not only the children of the ‘detenidos-desaparecidos,’ but also ex-political prisoners, exiled people, and other citizens who might not have directly suffered the repression of the Argentinian civic-military dictatorship, but who understand that we all are children of the same history.The Grupo de Arte Callejero (GAC) has engaged in acts of urban intervention since the late 80s, dealing with issues of human rights. Together with H.I.J.O.S., GAC actively participates in the “escraches” (acts of public shaming) that expose the specific places where dictatorship has carried out its injustice and impunity—e.g., current homes of ex-torturers, buildings that were used as detention and torture centers, etc. During recent years, GAC has expanded its activism to single out other modes of injustice under democracy, such as the criminalization of social protests, the impunity of police officers in the state of security, the news media’s monopoly and the housing market.

The video features scenes of their acción in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, during the first Hemispheric Institute Encuentro, in Rio de Janeiro, 2000. They placed signs in the streets, reminding all the pending cases of torture, murder, and disappearance during the Argentine dictatorship that are still waiting for justice. With this acción, words, and music,  they intend to grab the attention of people in the streets so that they can engage in a conversation about Human Rights in different Latin American countries.

Their ethno-techno proposal brings together that which has been labeled as ‘primitive’ and the technologies of the present.[BIO] La Pocha Nostra is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists. It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ephemeral communities of like-minded rebels.The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier.

They got together to expand alliances with groups that work on similar topics: the disappeared people during dictatorships, and the necessity to denounce impunity. EDEMA unveils the trauma of disappeared bodies through the striking the materiality of a body on stage. Sensorial stimuli accompany the bodily presence: sound, noise, percussion, fire, dance are mingled with pictures, videos, and pictures of the disappeared. With this performance, EDEMA points out that forced disappearance is a crime related not only to Latin American dictatorships, but also to democratic governments’ responsibilities: ‘el silencio es cómplice de la ausencia’ (silence is complicit of absence).","Disappeared persons--Argentina -- Latin America; body politics; Impunity -- Argentina.","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

In the Q&A, Maris Bustamante renders her understanding of what non-objective arts are, and how gender roles can perform in art. A juicy conversation about her trajectory includes insights about gender and sexuality, feminist art, maternity, and her work with Polvo de gallina negra and No-Grupo. [BIO] Maris Bustamante is neo trans post conceptualist strident visual producer. Since her first happening in 1971, Maris Bustamante (1949, Mexico) — a graduate from the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda at Mexico City—began ‘a search for non-traditional support’ or what she called ‘non-objective art.’ In 1977, along with other artists, she started a movement of ‘savage vanguard’ called ‘No-Grupo.’ With No-Grupo Bustamante created humored and caustic performances where gender was a major source material. In 1983, Bustamante and Mónica Mayer founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder) - a name based in the popular belief that black hen’s powder is a protection against evil eye or, in this case, attacks against feminism.","Art, abstract --- non-objective art; visual arts -- political aspects; Feminist art --- Latin America; No-Grupo (Artists’ group)","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

She asks audience members to take a whiff of the onion and asks what would they cry about.

During the several years of their existence, they have createda personal aesthetics founded upon the authorial work of the actor, both onthe stage and on the streets. Their venue, the Terreira da Tribo deAtuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz, works as a community theatre school,offering several free workshops open to the public. Their tribalorganization is based on the principle of collective work, both in thecreative process and in the maintenance of the space. For Ói Nóis AquiTraveiz, theater is an instrument for both revealing and analyzing reality,and it's function is social — to contribute to the collective knowledgeand to the improvement of the quality of life of the people. In a worldmarked by exclusion, marginalization, homogenization, by dehumanizing andbarbaric efforts, they see it as their moral imperative to denounceinjustice, sold opinions, authoritarianism, mediocrity and the erasing ofmemory. Ói Nóis sees theatre as an art of resistance, in the service ofarts and politics, an art that does not fit the market patterns for ethicsand aesthetics. Instead, they see theater as a way of life and as a vehiclefor ideas: a theater that does not comment on life, but that takes part init.[SYNOPSIS] Based on Sophocles' play, this performance intertwines text fragments by Albert Camus, Anaïs Nin, Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht, Dante Alighieri, Edgar Alan Poe, Ezra Pound, Fiodor Dostoievski, Friedrich Nietzsche, Heiner Müller, Hölderlin, Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, Jean Paul Sartre, Julian Beck, Lao Tsé, and Mallarmé. Ói Nóis found in the Greek Tragedy of Sophocles a space todiscuss the civil disobedience of the individual against the oppression ofthe State. The play is adapted into an environmental performance, begginingwith the battle between Thebes and Argos in the courtyard of the Terreira,and progressing through the five different environment the audiencecrosses, including a desert covered in tons of sand. The adaptation doesnot follow the classical structure but is divided into a non-realisticsequence of 30 scenes, including a dialogue between a mother and a son whodeserted war, an added scene that tells the story from the point of view ofthe people instead of that of nobility, which classical tragedy privileges.The performance lasts three hours and accomodates fifty spectators, who areinvited both to watch and to participate in scenes such as the 'Bacchanal,'featuring the cutting off and ritual burial of a giant phallus that Creontewears by a Maenad. Text fragments from Camus, Artaud, Brecht, Nietzsche,Heiner Müller, Julian Beck, and several other authors, are intertwinedinto the narrative with the purpose of opening up the Greek story intoother political situations.","Oi Nóis Aqui Traveiz (Theater group : Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil)|Theater--Brazil--Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul)|Theater--Political aspects--Brazil","Tribo de Atuadores Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz",,

Tim Miller explores bits and pieces of his body, in the same manner than, piece by piece, the story keeps flowing and ‘giving birth’ to the queer body. Through storytelling and movement, and stories of love, enchantment, disenchantment, and resistance, this solo show transforms a personal story into the story of a community. The ghost of fear and death appears with the AIDS epidemic, the loss of friends and loved ones, police brutality against gay people, and the State of California anti gay laws and homophobic harassment. A travel in time through the body, Tim Miller’s striking performance invokes the bodies of those who are absent but present at the same time. The gesture of envisioning a future with a United States’ lesbian president, with sexual freedom, and without homophobia, transforms sex into a call to life and hope. [BIO] Tim Miller is an internationally acclaimed performance artist. Miller's creative work as a performer and writer explores the artistic, spiritual and political topography of his identity as a gay man. Miller's performances have been presented all over North America, Australia, and Europe in such prestigious venues as Yale Repertory Theatre, the Institute of Contemporary Art (London), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Presenting vignettes of life, love, suffering, and humor, Tim Miller offers a compelling storytelling about his own life in NYC in the 80s, signaling breathing as life assurance in a moment when the AIDS epidemic and the work with ACT UP dwelled in-between survival and disappearance. This solo piece emerged from Miller's aesthetic ambition to mirror gay society's cultural conflicts while ‘trying to find an artistic, spiritual and political response to the AIDS crisis.’ ‘Do it like your life depends on it,’ Miller declares, breathing rhythmically and deeply, ‘which it does. In and out. Breathe. Breathe out the lie that we don't belong together. Breathe in the love. Run naked through the streets of L.A. Proclaim the end of sadness. Celebrate the miracle of us.’ Song and water make the body vulnerable and strong at the same time, in connection with all those that might be dead but not really gone.

Though often portrayed as an extremely unhealthy cuisine, Terry traces Soul Food back to its plant-based origins and, in so doing, explores the intersections of institutional racism, poverty, and food insecurity. His extensive research into the history of the popular cuisine reveals both little-explored information about what Soul Food is, but also provides an opportunity for reclamation of ethnic cuisine and heritage. As Terry says, this knowledge will hopefully help move African-Americans, specifically, and others away from unhealthy stereotypes and the more indulgent foods which should only be eaten occasionally. As a chef and a food justice activist, Terry is committed to healthy and sustainable foodways as well as preserving cultural food legacies.Hip-Hop Theater Festival is dedicated to presenting and showcasing theater written by and about the Hip-Hop generation.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. The recent capitalist development in Brazil has led to the institutionalization of cultural production. Research in the arts, which had previously worked against the grain of dominant logics, is now frequently a conformist site of alternative inclusion within capital’s ideological order. Group Theater in São Paulo and the Commodification of Culture explores how dissonant voices in this process––including those of some São Paulo theater groups––are now looking for critical ways to confront the depoliticization and commodification that has been imposed by and is a result of the bare necessities of survival.[BIO] Sérgio de Carvalho is playwright and director of Companhia do Latão, a São Paulo theater group.

From the critical poetics of body art to the occupation of public space by social movements, the event invited participants to explore the borders, identities and practices through which subjectivities, hegemonies and counter-hegemonies are constructed in the spaces of the city and beyond. From a micropolitical perspective, the unconscious repression of the knowing-body is the greatest violence of the colonial enterprise. This keynote lecture examines how this violence is in the marrow of the modern Western culture that continues to structure our lives. Today, the toxic effects of this unconscious repression have reached a critical point, generating the vast crisis in which we are now immersed. In order to return to the knowing-body––free from the effects of trauma––it is necessary that we resist the actual state of things. This is not a matter of futurology, for signs of this return are emerging throughout the 'Global South'––a South that is multiple and whose borders are not geographically limited. These signs of return are blasts of oxygen at points where thought has been asphyxiated––a tireless redrawing of landscapes, an endless work. Is this the real political potency of art?[BIO] Suely Rolnik is a psychoanalyst, arts/culture critic, and curator.

Having fled from the horrors of a dictatorship, Malayerba emerged as a collective effort to follow the radical principle of equality in difference, and performing politics through the act of reinstating communal ties. Their aesthetics and political work is also related to their international theater labs - a site of communal culture and a space for constant investigation, where Malayerba ‘does not teach theater, but teaches how to learn theater.’[BIO] Grupo de Teatro Malayerba was founded in Quito in 1979 by Arístides Vargas, Susana Pautasso and María del Rosario 'Charo' Francés, immigrant actors originally from Argentina and Spain.

In 2001 Malayerba launched the theater journal 'Hoja de Teatro,' conceived as a forum for the theorization, criticism and dissemination of Ecuadorian theater practices. Malayerba approaches theater making as an artistic, ethical and technical realm where to engage in meaningful creative experiences through which to understand, assume and confront current sociopolitical processes.In working together, actors with various backgrounds and nationalities have shown that a multicultural blend is not only possible but also enriching, as differences lead to new identities, embodiments of dreams, memories, absences and pains that are at once local and universal.","Francés, Charo--Interviews; Grupo de Teatro Malayerba.

In this interview, Miguel Rubio talks about the crisis of representation related to the atrocities inflicted by political violence during the internal armed conflict in Peru (1980-2000). Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani worked closely with the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC organized the public hearings where the testimonies of the survivors revealed the extremes of violence performed by terrorist groups and the State alike. The group then asked: what can Yuyachkani, and what can theatre do in times of violence, death, and disappearance? These events marked a transformation in Yuyachkani’s work, that now considers its performances as being in-between presence and representation.[BIO] Miguel Rubio Zapata  is a director, theater researcher, and founding member of Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani.

He states, “The theatre that I do is to show that every human being uses the same languages as the actor on stage (passion, movements, and costumes depending on the scenery), but the actor has consciousness of it.” He touches on the inevitability of “doing” theatre: that in fact once we learn to speak the language of theater, it can be rehearsed in real life in order to “analyze possibilities.” Lastly, in relation to the spectator, Boal argues that they should not be passive, but active and transgressive, seeking to interfere and modify the performance that is presented to them.

Augusto Boal leads general exercises and invites participants to think about how to apply Theatre of the Oppressed techniques in a classroom setting. This video material also includes discussions and exercises on transgression.Augusto Boal was a theatre director, scholar, teacher; political representative and statesman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; international speaker and the creator of the Theatre of the Oppressed.  Born in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, Augusto Boal was formally trained in chemical engineering and attended Columbia University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1962 he was invited to work with Arena Theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he stayed until 1971 when he was arrested, tortured, and exiled.  His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed. The Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems.  The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.","Boal, Augusto.

His years directing and writing plays for Arena Theatre helped him to start slowly developing his own methodology, which continued in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Portugal, and Paris, following his exile from Brazil. That methodology would later culminate in the Theatre of the Oppressed. The Theatre of the Oppressed is a participatory theatre that fosters democratic and cooperative forms of interaction among participants. It is a ‘rehearsal theatre’ practiced by ‘spect-actors’ (not spectators) who have the opportunity to both act and observe empowering processes of dialogue and critical thinking. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the theatrical act is experienced as a conscious intervention, as a rehearsal for social action rooted in a collective analysis of shared problems.  The methodology can be divided into several techniques used by Augusto Boal: Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Forum Theatre, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre.","Boal, Augusto.

It is a story of the military dictatorship in Brazil and in Latin America. The story shows a group of exiled Brazilians that go through the social and individual experience of living, against their will, in a different homeland - in this case Chile, Argentina, and France. The group is formed by three couples of different social classes and ideologies (intellectuals, workers, and bourgeois) who are forced to live in the same space and face their differences and lack of freedom. The play deals with broad issues of exile, resulting in exclusion, denial, control, and intolerance, but also the fight for affirmation and resistance. [BIO] Augusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Theater of the Oppressed is a system of games and special techniques that aims at developing, in the oppressed citizens, the language of the theater, in order to help them fight against their oppressions and to transform the society that engenders those oppressions. The word Oppressed is used in the sense of s/he who has lost the right to express his/her wills and needs, and is reduced to the condition of obedient listener of a monologue. It must be used as an instrument of concrete social transformation, a tool of fighting against all forms class oppression, racism, sexism, and all kinds of discrimination.","Boal, Augusto --  Plays --- French|Political exile|Latin American dictatorships","Cecilia Boal, Fabian Boal, and Julian Boal",,

The play features three characters connected by political repression and torture: a husband, a wife who has been tortured, and an alleged torturer. Ói Nóis Aqui Traveiz’s staging continues their research into the teatro de vivência, and demonstrates the anguish experienced by Brazilians, Chileans, and all Latin Americans who lived through the late twentieth century, with the end of the military regimes: How can repressors and repressed live on the same earth, share a same table? How to heal a country traumatized by fear? The play explores not only the themes of torture, justice, fear, and healing, it also raises a series of questions: How to tell the truth if the mask we wear is identical to our face? How can we tell if our memory is saving or deceiving us? How to keep our innocence in an evil and corrupt world?

A procession walks by slowly, following the rhythm of a drum. The performance begins with a ritual preparation. In a circle, the indigenous people share bread and water, they sing and dance with war cries. The ceremony is interrupted by the arrival of an indigenous person in chains. The group releases him, but he falls at the feet of his companions. The tribe lets out a cry of pain, and with their bodies they form a totem. The sound of a bomb exploding is heard. The totems fall apart, the indigenous people are dead. In the middle of the circle, a single indigenous woman survives, yet three people come from the audience and surround the dead bodies with chains. The destruction is complete.

To create the visual imagery depicted in the frame, Chang placed a video camera on a 45-degree angle while filming the live performance in her studio. Positioning the camera at this angle changes the plane of the video and also reshapes how viewers see the footage of the performance. Viewers are not aware of this stylistic approach when watching the footage, but instead see a re-purposed view of the live performance that has been displayed vertically in the video. The approaches that Chang takes in Fountain are political in their form as well as content, addressing standards of beauty, representations of Asian women, and the problematics of the male gaze. Fountain was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s ‘History of the Future’ (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015. Patty Chang’s performative works deal with themes of gender, language, and empathy.  Working predominantly in video, Chang uses the medium to document her performances, often utilizing the camera’s potential to misrepresent. Her works often challenge viewers’ perceptions of what they see, frequently creating visual sleights of hand that highlight fantastical representations of ‘Asia.’  Chang’s work has been exhibited nationwide and internationally at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the New Museum in New York; the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the Hamburg Kunstverein in Hamburg, Germany; and the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden.

Despite the effort to maintain other physical spaces in Downtown New York, Franklin Furnace’s board determined that access to freedom of expression and a broader audience for emerging artists through new media would be the prime focus of the arts organization. The virtual turn for Franklin Furnace was a radical move that marked the organization’s shift from exhibiting avant-garde work in physical spaces to online realms. Through this gesture, Franklin Furnace investigated the democratic landscape of the Internet as a censorship free space to present political art.

Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas.

Hughes reenacts scenes from the U.S. Supreme Court trial that she calls ‘theatrical spectacles,’ while noting the larger context of censorship in the arts in the United States. She de-centers national debates surrounding freedom, citizenship, and democracy from a lesbian feminist point of view and asserts her artistic freedom by creating performances that reflect a radical body politic. Hughes’ testimony, alongside those of Finley, Fleck, and Miller, led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in favor of the NEA Four’s case against the National Endowment for the Arts.

Sprinkle begins with her transformation from Ellen Steinberg to Annie Sprinkle, an act that prompted her sexual revolution.  In this process of becoming, Sprinkle critiques patriarchal ideals of female  sexuality and second-wave feminist anti-porn agendas. While critical of the male gaze, Sprinkle engages the gesture by posing on her own terms and affirming her sexual pleasure to re-appropriate the gaze throughout the performance. She provides a playful critique of the National Endowment for the Arts, alluding to her exhibit Carnival Knowledge (1984) presented by Franklin Furnace, which was reprimanded by the federal agency for its feminist pornographic content. Sprinkle discusses the labor politics of the sex work industry and her close relationships to clients, some of whom were disabled, lesbian, transgender, or gay men with HIV/AIDS. During the AIDS epidemic, Sprinkle focused her sex work on developing new practices such as the breath orgasm, a technique created with Barbara Carrellas, which allowed those infected with the disease to experience pleasure without having intercourse. This shift in Sprinkle’s work prompted the transformation of Annie into Anya, a persona who embodies the sacred energy of ancient goddess prostitutes.

Wilson situates performance art as a confrontational form that emerged from Futurism, Constructivism, and Dadaism in the early 20th century.  She describes the radical nature of performance art as a medium that transmits conceptual thinking through live actions, as evidenced by the work of Franklin Furnace artists Karen Finley, Annie Sprinkle, and Scarlet O. Wilson explains how the political subject matter embodied by these artists—feminism, pornography, and sexuality—impacted Franklin Furnace as an arts organization in the conservative climate of the culture wars. She notes the consistent attacks by religious right groups on Franklin Furnace that led to defunding from the National Endowment for the Arts, as the organization was accused of presenting obscene art with government funds. Despite the upheaval, Wilson, in true avant-garde fashion, insisted that ‘Until they cart me away in a straightjacket, I am going to continue to present performance art.’ While an advocate for government funding, Wilson is critical of the regulation of content in the arts—a phenomenon that did not manifest in other sectors of public funding at the time. Martha Wilson is a pioneering gallery director and feminist artist who creates innovative photographic and video works that explore her female subjectivity. Wilson founded Franklin Furnace in 1976, an artist-run space that champions the exploration, promotion, and preservation of artist books, temporary installation, performance art, as well as online works.  She has been described by New York Times critic Holland Cotter as one of ‘the half-dozen most important people for art in downtown Manhattan in the 1970s.’  Wilson has received fellowships for performance art from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts; Bessie and Obie awards for commitment to artists’ freedom of expression; a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts; a Richard Massey Foundation-White Box Arts and Humanities Award; and an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University. www.marthawilson.com","Wilson, Martha, 1947- ; Franklin Furnace (Archive); Franklin Furnace (Archive)--History ; Avant-garde (Aesthetics)--United States ; Avant-gardes in performance","COPYRIGHT HOLDER: Martha Wilson",,

Between Menopause and Old Age aims to demystify the horror of old age in an ironic way, inventing a deranged aesthetic and a moral solution for the 'problem of age.' Rocio Boliver hopes that her mockery of this absurd contemporary reality exposes a broken society based on looks, and challenges the ways in which old age has become synonymous with insult.[BIO] Rocio Boliver (La Congelada de Uva) has been active on the international art circuit for the last 20 years. In 1991, she began her performance career with the reading of porno-erotic texts, focusing her critique on the repression of women. Boliver’s work is historically situated amongst the most radical of Mexican Body Art.","menopause--political aspects; beauty culture--aging","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

For inside the verbs, pronouns, articles of the world’s Aboriginal languages are the keys to the planet’s long-term survival. Western languages hold that nature died at mankind’s eviction from a garden. Aboriginal languages refute this––to them, nature has a soul, the planet is a garden. Kill those languages and that vision––and the planet––would die.[BIO] Tomson Highway is a writer from northern Manitoba, producing works in Cree, French, and English. His plays include The Rez Sisters, Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing, and Rose. He is the author of the best-selling novel Kiss of the Fur Queen.

This event was prompted by the recent closure of Franklin Furnace by the New York Fire Department for being an 'illegal social club,' despite the organization’s growing recognition as an avant-garde gallery. Following the closure, Franklin Furnace was demonized by Republican Senator Jesse Helms for presenting Karen Finley's installation, A Woman's Life Isn't Worth (1990), which led to audits by the Internal Revenue Service and later to rescinded grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.  In Franklin Furnace Fights for First Amendment Rights, artists and guests address the growing wave of censorship in the arts, especially surrounding sexual, queer, and feminist content, as well as the conservative political agendas projected onto the artistic landscape of the United States.  Featured presenters in this video include Spalding Gray, Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, Eric Bogosian, Cee Brown, Allen Ginsberg, Diane Torr, Paul McMahon, Nancy Spero, and Leon Golub.[BIO] Franklin Furnace was founded in 1976 by artist Martha Wilson to champion ephemeral forms neglected by mainstream arts institutions. Franklin Furnace’s mission is to present, preserve, interpret, proselytize and advocate on behalf of avant-garde art, especially forms that may be vulnerable due to institutional neglect, their ephemeral nature, or politically unpopular content. The organization is dedicated to serving artists by providing both physical and virtual venues for the presentation of time-based visual art, including but not limited to artists’ books, installation art, performance art, and unforeseen contemporary avant-garde art forms; and to undertake other activities related to these purposes. Franklin Furnace is committed to serving emerging artists; to assuming an aggressive pedagogical stance with regard to the value of avant-garde art to life; and to fostering artists’ zeal to broadcast ideas.

To create the visual imagery depicted in the frame, Chang placed a video camera on a 45-degree angle while filming the live performance in her studio. Positioning the camera at this angle changes the plane of the video and also reshapes how viewers see the footage of the performance. Viewers are not aware of this stylistic approach when watching the footage, but instead see a re-purposed view of the live performance that has been displayed vertically in the video. The approaches that Chang takes in Fountain are political in their form as well as content, addressing standards of beauty, representations of Asian women, and the problematics of the male gaze. Fountain was intended to be part of Franklin Furnace’s 'History of the Future' (1999) netcast on Pseudo Programs, Inc.’s The Performance Channel (www.channelp.com); however, the corporation went bankrupt during the height of the culture wars leaving the performance footage dormant until published in full length by HIDVL in 2015. [BIO] Patty Chang’s performative works deal with themes of gender, language, and empathy.  Working predominantly in video, Chang uses the medium to document her performances, often utilizing the camera’s potential to misrepresent. Her works often challenge viewers’ perceptions of what they see, frequently creating visual sleights of hand that highlight fantastical representations of 'Asia.'  Chang’s work has been exhibited nationwide and internationally at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the New Museum in New York; the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the Hamburg Kunstverein in Hamburg, Germany; and the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. She was nominated for the Hugo Boss Prize in 2008, named the Guna S.

The play opens with nature sounds in a village setting in Nigeria. A man and woman engage in a conversation surrounding the man’s displeasure for the women’s appearance. As the two discuss the possibility of a relationship together, the male character is contradicting: he degrades her as a woman, but promises her the greatest romance. The woman is pressured into marrying the man, Baroka, who takes on the presence of the Lion. The woman, Sidi, will not conform to the tribal norm of marrying, however, and refuses to be the jewel. The play follows Sidi's struggle with Baroka and her village. At the end of the play, Sidi remains strong and rejects Baroka's marriage proposal, refusing to accept her position as inferior to men.[BIO]  From 1979-2009, the New WORLD Theater worked at the intersection of artistic practice, community engagement, scholarship, and activism toward a vision of a ""new world""--one that broke the confines of multiculturalism and was an artistic harbinger of America's shifting demographics.

The performance features dancing on stilts, juggling, puppets, big animal costumes, singing, and comedy, all of which provide political commentary on topics ranging from race and gender politics to survival tactics within an unfair legal and social system. Like all of Circus Amok's work, this performance uses satire and grotesque elements, along with direct audience interactions. [BIO] Circus Amok is a New York City-based circus-theater company whose mission is to provide free public art addressing contemporary issues of social justice to the people of New York City. Directed and founded by Jennifer Miller, the group has been together since 1989, bringing its funny, queer, caustic, and sexy, political one-ring spectacles to diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Over the years the traditional circus skills--tight-rope walking, juggling, acrobatics, stilt walking, and clowning--have been combined with experimental dance, life-sized puppetry, music old and new, gender-bending performance art, and improvisational techniques, to create new meanings for circus while continuing to entertain crowds of all ages throughout the city streets, gardens, parks, and playgrounds. Circus Amok invites the audience to join them in envisioning a more empowered life of community interaction while enjoying a celebratory, queer spectacle.","Circus -- New York (State) -- New York|Street theater -- New York (State) -- New York|Queer performance|Political performance","Circus Amok",,"This is Part 2 of HI2015.009: DMD is the same"

Expressed through ritualistic acts, Athey  and his fellow performers, Divinity P.

Heightened by national homophobia and conservative agendas, Athey, who is HIV-positive, was falsely accused by the Minneapolis Star and other media outlets for exposing the audience to AIDS-tainted blood, when in fact the blood central to the performance was from performer Divinity P. Fudge, who is HIV-negative. The polemic of blood in the performance ignited discrimination and censorship of Athey’s work across art venues and by the National Endowment for the Arts. Athey was also attacked by the religious right for employing a queer lens to examine religion, gender, and sexuality. Through the performance, Athey and company manifest a stigmata of the queer body that sparked national debates on censoring and exhibiting sexually explicit art.

In doing so, she retraces a part of her lost identity as a black woman and lesbian, while also forming a body politic around race, gender, and sexuality. Expanding upon the lineage of these black women figures, Sneed navigates the tensions between freedom and slavery in a post-civil rights era, noting the psychological impact of colonial, patriarchal, and capitalist structures.

It premiered at Patrick's Cabaret in Minneapolis in 1994, and subsequently toured to Winston-Salem, San Francisco, Boston, New York, Anchorage and Leicester, England.  'Sweet Sadie' is inspired by autobiography, and dramatizes Branner's tumultuous maternal relationship with his mother. By physically embodying his mother in the first part of the performance, Branner performs his perceptions of his mother's trials and tribulations, feelings, and reactions to various life events that led up to Branner's birth and growth into a young man, exploring cultural and colloquial ideas of parenting as a single, divorced black mother. Later, he switches into his own persona to speak about how he felt as a young, gay, black man raised by a woman like his mother, demonstrating his effort to empathize with his mother. The second half of the performance focuses on Branner coping with the slow loss of his mother through Alzheimer's, and her subsequent death. Ultimately unable to reconnect with her, he found solace in reaching out to her spirit through song and reminiscence. 'Sweet Sadie' stands as Branner's love letter and testament to his mother, exploring the rocky yet tender relationship between the two and how, without her presence in his life, Branner would not be where he is today, in his life or in his art.[BIO] Djola Branner is an interdisciplinary artist/educator who combines movement, sound, and light to create compelling portraits of American life for the stage.

One of the early works called ‘The Peasants’ Story’ was an important turning point for the Theater of the Oppressed, because it taught Boal and his fellow actors not to create plays that demanded actions and risks they themselves were not ready to take, ‘I will never again going to do plays to insight people to do things I am not ready to do.’ From here, with Forum Theater Boal began to encourage others to join to express themselves and create theater works, such as ‘The Naked People Scene.’ In this way, people understood their problems to be political and them as active participants in opposing their oppression.[BIO] Augusto Boal is an innovative and influential Brazilian theatrical director, writer, pedagogue and politician. He is considered to be on of the most important creators of political theater since Brecht. Boal is the author of Theater of the Oppressed, Games for Actors and Non-Actors, Rainbow of Desire, Legislative Theater, among others. He was a Member of Parliament for Rio de Janeiro from 1993-1996. Boal is the founder of Theater of the Oppressed, a political theatrical form originally used in radical popular education movements, growing up alongside Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed.

Having marginalized people participate in the theater and express their problems, Boal brought attention to these issues through his political position and projects of law. The efforts of the Theater of the Oppressed to make substantial political change and extend the potential of democracy, led to the passing of 13 laws in Rio. In this performance, Boal recreates the years of Legislative Theater by breaking the participants into groups and giving them a socio-political issue to improvise and act on, such as minimum wage. As the 5 plays happen simultaneously, Boal offers ‘We present the problem, but the solution comes from you,’ to re-enforce that the political power comes from the people as they express their frustrations, create and propose legislation.

A Book of Hours (1999), an across-the-border collaborative performance piece, focuses on the violence against women in colonial Mexico, especially the incarceration of women in Belen, a charitable ‘home’/prison founded in 1683 for unwed mothers and other socially marginalized women. The collaboration took shape over a period of two years. The collaborators include Ruth Malechech, director of New York-based Mabou Mines, Jesusa Rodríguez, Mexican director, actor, writer, and feminist activist, and her partner, Argentine-born singer-composer Liliana Felipe, visual artist Julie Archer, and poet Catherine Sasanov who, at the time, was writing poems inspired by the history of Mexico City and the circumstances of the founding of Belén. Sasanov´s poetry became the base of the script (consisting of song lyrics, projected writings, and minimal dialogue). Debuting in the 1999 Festival del Centro Histórico in March at the Claustro of Sor Juana in Mexico City, it then opened at P.S. 122 in New York City in May 1999 and has since played in various U.S. cities and returned to Mexico. While working on the piece, the women were deeply affected by reports of unsolved rapes and murders of hundreds of young women working in the maquila factories in U.S.-Mexico border towns. Official indifference to this violence echoed the stories the artists were uncovering about the women in Belén.[BIO] Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist, Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Her ""espectáculos"" (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ""carpa,"" to performative acts within political projects. She and her partner, Argentine singer/actor, own and operate El Habito and Teatro de la Capilla, alternative performances spaces in Mexico City. They have won an Obie for Best Actor in Las Horas de Belén, A Book of Hours (1999) with Ruth Maleczech and New York-based Mabou Mines. Rodíguez contributes regularly to Mexico's most important feminist journal, debate feminista.Liliana Felipe is one of Argentina's major composer and songwriter. With Jesusa Rodriguez, her partner for the last 30 years, she owned and ran El Hábito, one of Mexico's most important alternative performance spaces, and composed songs to most of Rodriguez's performances as she continued her own recording career.","Mexico--Colonization|Incarceration|Violence against women|Mabou Mines (Theater group)|Rodríguez, Jesusa|Felipe, Liliana|Maquila plants","El Hábito",,

The stage floor is completely covered in fur, a grounding in the performance's animal-human dichotomy and the tension between embracing and engulfing. Three dancers appear as anthropomorphic figures, pivoting between animal and human gestures and sounds. They are three figures that pulsate, and this pulsation functions as motor to a gear that provokes accidents: it means, encounters, collisions, falls, affections.Their polyphonic utterances and contrasting movements explore abrupt shifts in tone—from frenetic to subdued, from docile to carnal—creating a blurring within and beyond the limits of the human. Monstrous Nature intersects micro-narratives and fictions reminiscent of mythology, building a surreal space for the audience to offer multiple interpretations of what takes place on stage.

The group chose December 12 for its day of action because it was the last day of COP21 in Paris, the 21st annual convention of parties of the United Nations to address climate change. #D12 mobilized thousands of demonstrators to take the streets and march with signs, balloons, and red banners to call the attention of the UN leaders and emphasize how crucial it is to create sustainable, lasting climate justice.

Since 1947, the Arabs of Palestine and the Jews of Israel have been fighting over the land now occupied by Israel. After the Arab-Israeli War of 1947-1948, the majority of the land was taken to form the state of Israel, while over one million Palestinian refugees were forcibly relocated to the relatively small territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  After the elections of 2006, the militant Hamas political party took power in Palestine, seizing total control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, in defiance of former peace agreements between Israel and Palestine from the early 1990s. Various failed attempts at a truce marked the next several years, but the violence steadily increased until 2014, when Israel launched a full military operation to stop rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. In June 2014, Israeli airstrikes commenced, followed by a ground invasion into Gaza in July, which lasted until a ceasefire was reached in August. Afterward, Israel reinstated its blockade of Gaza, preventing an influx of the resources necessary for the Palestinians to rebuild, and leaving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians homeless for many months.  The Illuminator projection refers to this blockade and calls on the Israelis to end the siege and allow the refugees to rebuild.[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

Founded in 2011 in Moscow to advocate for feminism, LGBTQ rights, and opposition toward President Vladimir Putin, Pussy Riot staged public performances in Moscow, where they performed songs of rebellion and revolution, with lyrics that blatantly condemned the Russian government. After an infamous performance in Moscow's renowned Cathedral of the Savior, where the band performed before being stopped by church security (the video of the encounter was widely circulated online), three of the members were arrested in early March 2012 and charged with ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred."" The Illuminator projected their insistence for the Russian government to free Pussy Riot the day before the three members of the group were indicted and incarcerated for their protests. This court ruling prompted international criticism, and Pussy Riot's case was championed by multiple human rights groups.

The project involved embedding Illuminator member Grayson Earle within the Montreal student activist community for one month, in order to produce collaborative content for a series of interventions that took place during the Encuentro. Starting in 2012, the Montreal student activists were protesting the government's decision to increase college tuition by 80%. Heated encounters between law enforcement and the activists became more and more common as the demonstrations grew bolder and more controversial. Ultimately, the protests' focus grew to argue against the entire governmental structure, highlighting its overall failure to support its students and its citizens. To counteract the increasing size of these demonstrations, the Montreal city government passed a law known as P-6, which limits any protest without a permit to no more than fifty participants. When The Illuminator came to contribute to the demonstrations in 2014, they worked with Québécois students and activists to recreate moments of protest on a green screen, which were later projected back onto the city of Montreal as a creative circumvention of this law and in memoriam of the massive student strikes in Quebec of late 2011 and early 2012. The message ""On Est Plus Que 50"" emphasizes that, were it not for the P-6 Law, hundreds of protesters would continue to take to the streets, and that they continue to do so in spirit.[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

The performance shone light on the crisis of student debt in the United States, where the average college student graduates with approximately $30,000 or more in debt. It also projected the harsh realities of living with student debt.

The Morris Justice Project began in 2011 as a communal effort between mothers living in the South Bronx, who were outraged by the New York Police Department's treatment of their sons and determined to catalogue and document their experiences with the police. This took the form of an ongoing research project in collaboration with the Public Science Project, John Jay College, and Pace University Law Center, guided by social knowledge of the area's disproportionate experience of discriminatory policing practices, and with the ultimate aim of creating a collective vision of community safety. In New York City, Black and Latino people are overwhelmingly targeted and surveilled by the police. As a crowd watched from across the street, The Illuminator projected onto a high-rise apartment building the results of a survey conducted with 1000 local residents of the area about police behavior and experiences. Two short films were also projected: Julie Dressner's New York Times op-doc ""The Scars of Stop and Frisk,"" which follows a young black man in Brooklyn who had been stopped more than 60 times before age 18 by the police, and ""Community Safety Act"" by The New York Civil Liberties Union and Communities United for Police Reform, which details an effort to draft and pass legislation to end discriminatory policing in New York City, providing a community-based alternative. Both films address ""stop and frisk,"" a common practice of the New York Police Department where police officers stop and question a pedestrian, and then search (""frisk"") them for possible weapons and other contraband.

Occupy Wall Street began two months earlier, when a group of young activists occupied Zuccotti Park (formerly Liberty Park) in Lower Manhattan, capturing the world's attention and launching a global campaign against social and economic inequality, corporate greed, and corruption. They enacted a campground headquarters for their activities, and two days before the Bat Signal action, these activists were forcibly removed from the Park by the New York Police Department. The Bat Signal projection featured bold, colorful graphics of the activists' logo and mission. The projection begins with a circle reading ""99%"" to signify the movement's declaration that they are the 99% of people denied the financial and economic power that the Wall Street elite and uber-rich possess. Next, projections of declarations like ""Mic check,"" ""Another world is possible,"" and ""We are winning"" act as visual calls-to-action and words of encouragement for the crowds of OWS demonstrators as they march along the FDR highway on Manhattan's east side.[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

In 2010, Chelsea Manning, a US soldier stationed in Iraq, formerly known as Bradley Manning, began sending secret military and diplomatic files to Wikileaks to be published online. Her biggest submission was 250,000 State Department diplomatic cables in fall 2011. Her online conversations with Adrian Lamo, a hacker from California, prompted him to turn her over to the FBI for damaging US national security, and she and Julian Assange were quickly arrested. As of 2012, Assange resides in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, with Ecuador intent on shielding him from likely prosecution from the UK and the US. Assange is also wanted for questioning over a 2010 rape allegation from Sweden, and his residency in the London Embassy of Ecuador allows him to avoid extradition for that, as well.[BIO] The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

Throughout, MarcBamuthi Joseph tells the story of Haiti—the poorest nation in the WesternHemisphere with a long and violent history of exploitation. The plotrevolves around two kids torn between their Caribbean roots and growing upin the urban United States. This nonlinear collage of lives, myths, andexperiences has echoes of Shakespeare, anchored by Joseph’s performanceas Grandpere—a first generation, world-weary Prospero, determined toleave his Americanized grandchildren a sense of their place in history.To help realize the complex themes of the piece, Joseph merges urgentvoices, music, and movement through collaborations with Rennie Harris, JohnSantos, Adia Whitaker, and Kamilah Forbes. He also worked with three youngwriters from Youth Speaks on the performance. Maxence Denis, aFrench/Haitian visual artist, shot the documentary footage of Haiti in thepiece. Three live musicians provide a multilayered sound accompaniment fromthe cacopohonous to the bluesy, mixing beat-boxing rhythms with Caribbeantunes. The dancing in the piece is a mixture of African-based dance and hiphop. Propelled by the music, the choreography works with the text and movesthe narrative forward in the performance.

Themovement is complimented by the musical lyric, “The world turns 'roundand 'round, the world turns 'round and 'round.” While dancing on thefloor, Avilés’ red dress falls, revealing his penis to the audience.Avilés’ nudity becomes a queer act that affirms his sexuality and racialidentity on stage (as evidenced in many of his dances). He continues withsuch graphic movement phrases and patterns until the dance ends.[BIO] Arthur Avilés is a queer Puerto Rican dancer/choreographer based inthe Bronx, New York. Avilés was a member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie ZaneDance Company from 1987 to 1995. He later formed Arthur Avilés TypicalTheatre, a dance company based in the Bronx that seeks to create work thatplays on the margins of gay and Latino cultures. The company is housed atthe Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), which was founded in 1998 byAvilés and Charles Rice-González, a creative writer and communityactivist. Avilés’ work utilizes aspects of theater and dance, oftentaking the structure of stories from existing classics and reconfiguringthem in order to express the felt, actual, and fantastical lives of queerLatinos living in the ghetto. He received a Bachelors of Arts inTheater/Dance from Bard College under the direction of Jean Churchill,Lenore Latimer, Albert Reid, Susan Osberg, and Aileen Passloff. He wasawarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater in 2015.","Aviles, Arthur|Dance|Dance--1990-2000|Dance--United States|Dance New York (State) New York|Choreography--United States|Nudity in dance","Arthur Avilés",,"*NOTE*: Documentation of the dance on the video is looped, so please only digitize footage from 00:00:29--00:07:02Run time for Bobst Library: Please digitize video from 00:00:29--00:07:02; performance ends at 00:07:02; please disregard any performance footage following the end time) TRT:  00:06:33"

For this piece, Aviléscasts dancers of different racial backgrounds and sexual identities. Theperformers have movement backgrounds in modern dance, jazz, and ballet, andvarious levels of formal training. One performer has no previous trainingand appears on stage for the first time. Furthermore, all the dancers inthe piece are from the Bronx—a political gesture by Avilés to placeUptown bodies on the Downtown stage. In REAL MEN, nude male brown bodies oscillate between movement phrases andcontact forms. The movement derives from Avilés’ Initial Response—achoreographic strategy that uses non-thinking to create a series ofmovement phrases. As the male dancers slowly undulate across the floor, afemale dancer enters wearing a tuxedo and mustache. The dancers perform thesame movements together, blurring the lines of gender. Here, Avilés worksto confront the historical gender binaries in dance by challenging the waysin which gender is perceived and performed on stage. REAL MEN premiered as part of the all-male dance series “In the Companyof Men.” Avilés was the first choreographer to invite a woman to performon stage in the series. He asserts that REAL MEN “is as much a socialjustice act as it is a dance piece. It is about men of color andconnection. REAL MEN is a unique dance piece for its time.”","Aviles, Arthur|Dance--United States|Dance New York (State) New York|Choreography--United States|Dance and race|Dance and homosexuality|Gender identity in dance|Nudity in dance","Arthur Avilés",,"Preserve video from 00:00:39--00:13:10; performance ends at 00:13:10; please disregard any performance footage that follows the performance end time) TRT: 00:12:31"

This action, which took place September 21, 2013, was in solidarity with 350.org., an online-based nonprofit organization, working toward building a global, grassroots climate movement by creating online campaigns and mass public actions to hold world leaders accountable and to actually address climate change. The Illuminator's projections showcased the collective's opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline, a 1,179 mile (1,897 km) pipeline running from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska. This pipeline would carry almost a million barrels of oil each day into the U.S., allowing for the nation to decrease its dependency on Middle Eastern oil. It is incredibly controversial due to its likely damaging effects on the environment, with a possibility for oil and chemical spills affecting the fragile ecosystems with which the pipeline intersects. The U.S. decision to approve or reject the further development of the Keystone XL Pipeline was also seen as symbolic of the U.S.'s energy future and whether the country would continue to use fossil fuels or transition to clean, renewable energy.

In a collaborative projection with the Illuminator, the Guerrilla Girls also intervened at the re-opening of the Whitney Museum, a modern art museum in Lower Manhattan.

Through its combination of voice and image, Not Ready to Make Nice offers a glimpse into this anonymous group of artists and the message behind their work.

Trump started constructing this golf course as the first part of a luxury resort project and received much criticism for choosing land legally protected by the Scottish government in order to preserve its environment and fragile ecosystem. Throughout the golf course development and construction, Trump was embroiled in numerous legal battles with homeowners whose land he bought with the intention of seizing the additional land around them, thereby increasing their property values tremendously and making it so they could no longer afford their homes. Trump's insistence to continue the project also greatly affected the planned construction of a wind turbine farm located near the property. His plan was to eliminate it altogether so the turbines would not block the golfers' view, and in effect ridding the town of much needed renewable energy. When the government decided to move ahead with building the wind farm, Trump sued the Scottish government, creating an expensive legal battle. The Illuminator's projections of videos and protest graphics shed light on the capitalist arrogance of the Trump golf course, and cheered on the efforts of Occupy Wall Street, the activist organization speading a worldwide message to dismantle the oppressive system granting the über-rich—people like Donald Trump—power worldwide.""[BIO]""The Illuminator is a political art collective based in New York City that utilizes guerrilla projections in the urban landscape as their primary strategy for intervention.

In the United States, student debt has become a huge crisis, with the average college student graduating with approximately $30,000 in debt or more.

The People's Pad was first used at 5 Pointz, a historical graffiti mecca in Long Island City, Queens immediately after its public and highly controversial white washing. The outdoor art exhibit space, utilizing the exterior of a factory warehouse, is named 5Pointz for bringing together the five boroughs of New York City in one central hub for graffiti and street art. However, its impact has been worldwide, as 5Pointz was affectionately called the ""United Nations of Graffiti"" for its global prestige and popularity. Graffiti is often criminalized as public vandalism within urban spaces, historically associated with communities of color using graffiti to protest institutionalized racism and economic oppression. With gentrification sweeping New York City, the owners of 5Pointz decided to develop the warehouses into luxury condominiums, stating that they had always wanted to do so and that the murals were simply a temporary allowance. The New York City Planning Commission voted to begin developing the condos, whereas the Landmark Committee vehemently opposed it, citing that the location was a historical monument to the legacy and culture of New York graffiti artists. On November 19, 2013, the hundreds of thousands of feet of graffiti accumulated over twenty years were painted white overnight and effectively erased.

No Red Tape drew from previous Columbia University-based efforts to protest the university's inaction regarding rape cases, utilizing more radical methods to bring awareness to the issue. Broadcasting text onto a centrally located, iconic building on campus like the Low Library, reflects No Red Tape’s ongoing commitment to holding the university accountable in public and highly visible ways. Through actions such as public rallies and interruptions of prospective student information sessions, the group continually aims to bring conversations about gender-based violence into the public sphere. The projection also reflected the central role of art in the movement against campus sexual violence. Over the course of 2014, the most visible example of such artistic tactics was Columbia visual arts student Emma Sulkowicz’s Carry That Weight, her thesis project where she carried around her twin-sized dorm mattress everywhere, from class to the bathroom, for the entire school year, focusing on the emotional weight she must carry as a survivor of campus rape, as well as the weight of the university's inaction to prosecute and expel her rapist, another Columbia student.

Gentrification is the process of revonating deteriorating urban neighborhoods by pushing out lower-income residents to make way for more affluent ones, and rent increase is an effective way of doing so. Text and visuals of Occupy Wall Street, a global campaign against social and economic inequality, and corporate greed and corruption, highlighted the movement's solidarity with the rent strikers of Sunset Park, and to portray the message that affordable housing is a human right, not an economic liability. The Illuminator chose to cast projections at the corner of 42nd Street and 5th Avenue as it is an ideal location for pedestrians in Sunset Park, and is one of the highest points in Brooklyn to view projections alongside the Manhattan skyline. In a city as expensive as New York, the Rent Strike projections created a visual emphasis on the need for economic equality. The project was created in collaboration with the Overpass Light Brigade, an art activism group based in Wisconsin that uses string lights to write illuminated messages onto wooden panels, and then holds up these light panels in public spaces to make a highly visible statement on a variety of social justice issues.

At the same time, they fostered the creation ofCorporación Colombiana del Teatro and have developed a number oftheoretical works that reflect upon dramatic creation, its methods andlanguages.

The visual vocabulary of Consideration Liberation Army was inspired by the iconography of American radicals of the 1960s. Many groups of that eracombined flamboyance, militancy, and eloquence to push democratic andsocial reform forward (i.e., The Weather Underground, Students for aDemocratic Society, the Black Panthers, etc.). The histories of theseradical movements are rife with heartbreak, failures of judgment, foolishextremes, and bloody tragedy. They are also brimming with brilliantideologies, inspiring orators, profound collective action, greatcultural/artistic achievements, and high style.

It is also ametaphorical tale about the oppressive nature of conformity, and thecreative, heroic ways that people have circumvented it. Out of amale-dominant and racist Lone Ranger and Tonto legend, the performancecreates an alternative narrative of other, less-often-heard, realities. Thepiece uses the convention of storytelling to question the role of storiesin creating the dominant culture’s vision of North America, and theveracity of the stories themselves. Performed with a live musical score byDiane Kooch (bass). “What happens when the Lone Ranger takes off the mask? When the fabricslips and rips and shifts? What happens when the mask falls, leaving hernaked between the bridge and the brow?”This piece is part of Tales for A New World, a series of performances thattakes as their inspiration the stories that form North American mythology:yarns and fables belonging to cowboys, Indians, voyageurs, spinsters, andbig city Horatio Algers. These are tales which have been glamourized bypopular culture, and which exist in iconic proportions. Yet they arerelatively young, pliable stories, no more than 200 years old. Dempsey andMillan bend them so they reflect a different perspective. By imposing anironic lesbian and feminist reading/retelling upon these tales, theyilluminate our history and our present, and create alternative archetypesthat propose new “new worlds.”[BIO]Collaborators since 1989, Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan are amongCanada’s best-known performance artists.

The live performance was reconceived by Dempsey and Millan, and became a film in 1990. Created as a mock music video, it upends expectations by replacing the conventional brooding, straight, white, male star with a giant vulva. She goes about her day (shopping, banking, working at a construction site), embodying the most basic part of her identity.Since its inception, this piece has created an array of controversy. When the film was released in 1990, a provincial Member of Parliament suggested that an X rating be created in Manitoba to ensure children would never see it. The National Film Board of Canada, which funded the film, received threatening phone calls. Because of its inclusion in Hallwalls Centre for Contemporary Art’s support material in 1998, the US National Endowment for the Arts suspended all funding to Hallwalls for one year. After screening the film to high school students at University of Winnipeg in 2001, a parent complained, resulting in a media firestorm locally known as “Veggiegate” (Dempsey and Millan were erroneously accused of teaching teenage girls how to masturbate with vegetables).Nonetheless, this piece has played globally to an estimated audience of over one million viewers, and has been aired on the CBC in Canada and Canal+ in Europe.

The purity and innocence of the dress, the open expression of """"wanting"""", and the sweetness of delivery together create an assumption that the object of affection discussed is the traditional heterosexual partner.

Lamar examines the sexual politics surrounding thesurveillance of the black male body in Surveillance Punishment and TheBlack Psyche (2013). Set in the American South, Lamar portrays a death rowprisoner who sings about the historical legacy of black men being watchedby white overseers. Performed in the tradition of the spiritual, the song'snarrative centers around a slave condemned to death for killing his masterwhom he loved. Throughout this plantation fantasy, the politics ofinterracial and same-sex desire are explored from a black man’s point ofview. As evidenced in the lyric “With his touch I felt free,”discipline becomes a form of pleasure rather than punishment. Here, Lamarreverses the power dynamic of the white male overseer’s gaze—the blackslave associates his master’s watch with affection rather thanpersecution. As the song ends, the prisoner alludes to the prison-industrialcomplex as a form of modern day slavery, while connecting the role policesurveillance plays in enforcing such oppression. Ultimately, blackness isalways under surveillance and subjected to punishment by whitesupremacy.""[BIO]""M. Lamar is a composer working in music, performance,video, sculpture, and installation. Drawing heavily from the Negrospiritual, Lamar uses his operatic voice and piano playing to comment onthe politics of blackness.  He combines western classical music anddissonant black metal to create narratives of radical becomings.  Lamar haspresented work at the New Museum, MoMA PS1, Participant Inc., The Kitchen,PS122, among other international art venues.

Inthis excerpt, Drucker engages in a trans-generational dialogue with MotherFlawless Sabrina inside of her New York City apartment—a salon for queersand artists since 1968. The acts the artists perform can be view asembodied repertoires that transmit memory, identity, and culture acrosstime and space.

Furthermore, Drucker andSabrina use film to record their artistic relationship through a translens, as both creators and subjects of the work. The artists create a newvision for transgender performativity and construct a historical narrativeon their own terms.

This 1988 festival at Toronto’s Harbourfront Centrewas the first WOMAD festival to take place in North America andforegrounded Toronto’s strong multicultural community with performancesfrom local artists of Caribbean, African, Asian and Native Canadiandescent. Performing tracks from her Juno Award winning Reggae/Calypsoalbums, Revolutionary Tea Party (1986) and Conditions Critical (1988),Lillian Allen powerfully demonstrates the political power of stylisticfusion within a diasporic setting. With “Rub a Dub Style Inna RegentPark” Allen integrates Jamaican English with specific Toronto geographyand contemporary urban influences to illustrate how diasporic spaces bothcall for and produce subversive new musical and textual styles. Similarly,with “I Fight Back” Allen enacts a code-switching style that fights theimposition of Standard English as an indicator of hierarchical knowledgestructures and situates Jamaican English as linguistically displaced andyet empowered. And, as always, Allen brings to the highly politicized genreof dub poetry her woman-identified perspective with performances of“Birth Poem,” “Nelly Belly Swelly,” and “Sister HoldOn”—works that use sound and music as visceral mediums to break taboosabout women’s lived experiences. This documentation includes anintroduction by Clifton Joseph, and the following reggae dub poetry pieces:“I Fight Back,” “Birth Poem,” “Nellie Belly Swelly,” “NaturalRights,” “Sister Hold On,” “Rub-a-Dub Style inna Regent Park,”“Conditions Critical,"" and “The Subversives.”[BIO]Lillian Allen isrecognized as a key originator and a leading exponent of dub poetry—ahighly politicized form of poetry that is sometimes set to music and isconsidered a literary godmother of rap, hip-hop and spoken word poetry.Originally from Spanish Town, Jamaica, Allen has been an influential figureon the global cultural landscape for over four decades.

But as this compilation of performances at twodisparate locations—the Canadian League of Poets Benefit (1990) and the15th Michigan Womyn's Music Festival (1990)—illustrates, Allen’s bordercrossings also transcend institutional, political, and aestheticenclosures. Through both form and content, Allen’s dub poetry speaks alanguage of political intersectionality. Often credited with opening up thedub form to feminist content and sensibilities, Allen has also been at theforefront of the struggle to have dub poetry recognized as a literary form.Just six year’s prior to her reading at the Canadian League of Poets,Allen and fellow dub poets Clifton Joseph and Devon Haughton were refusedmembership in the League on the grounds that they were performers ratherthan poets. The League’s refusal of membership exposes the ways in whichnormative assumptions about poetry and literature construct borders ofinclusion and exclusion based in hierarchical norms of class, culture, andrace. Notably, in 1992, the League awarded Allen the Foremother of CanadianPoetry prize. The documentation of performances at the Canadian League ofPoets Benefit includes readings of the poems ""Dark Winds"" and ""Jazz Poem,""while the documentation of the 15th Michigan Womyn's Festival includes theReggae Dub Poetry pieces (with musical backup) ""Fine Mary,"" ""Nellie BellySwelly,"" and ""Birth Poem.""

The footage includes the following performances: ""Intoxicating Calm"" (1992), a solo by Arthur Aviles in which he performs quick, rigorous, athletic phrases that form movement and character sketches reflective of his internal feelings.""Untitled #1: After Martha Graham"" (1994) is a piece where Arthur inspires himself in the movement vocabulary of choreographer Martha Graham, reimagining her Diversion of Angels, and of course, dancing all three of them. """"If I see something I like, why shouldn't I use it, especially it it inspired me? Originilaty is dead, but inspiration is alive. I put myself into that artwork and see what it does for me,"""" said Aviles in an interview with Lawrence M. La Fountain-Stokes.""Ritual Dance"" (2000) features a group of dancers wearing white costumes that emphasize upper body gestures as they clap and move across the floor with stomping leg movements.""Arturella"" (1996) is a queer interpretation of the fairy tale Cinderella. Aviles uses his “autobiographical fantasy” method to recast the classic tale as a gay romance set in the South Bronx’s Latino community. He integrates Spanish and Spanglish into the narrative and assigns Latino names to all the characters in the fairy tale. Most of the movement in the dance is copied from the cartoon characters featured in Walt Disney’s motion picture Cinderella. It also features traditional Puerto Rican danza steps, as well as movement taken from West Side Story. The dance’s soundtrack is a collage of music and sounds taken from Disney’s Cinderella. ""This Great and Pleasant Asylum"" (1999) is a duet with Arthur's partner and collaborator Charles Rice-González. As the fabric moves and unravels, their own love and intimacy comes up, disguised as choreography, to create a fissure in the narratives of loneliness, grief and death and in the racist and homophobic discourse of the 80s and early 90s through the gorgeous strength of racialized male partnership. Nude and joined by their mouths, they come out and fly away together.""Maéva: A New York Rican's Ensalada"" (1991) features a group of dancers who combine traditional Puerto Rican dance with Western forms, followed by the character Maéva who performs a monologue about her mother, in which she inquires on the """"ensalada"""" that is to exist in between two distinct worlds and cultures - and how disidentification shapes that body.""Narcissus"" (1998) features Arthur and company performing a series of movement and contact phrases at varying speeds and levels to dramatic classical music.""5 Star Dance"" (1997) centers classical and contemporary movement techniques which are explicated across the dance floor to classical music.""Elysian Fields"" (1999) is a 15-dancer piece with choreography inspired by the dynamics of the visuals and editing from Michael Auder's video BROODING ANGELS: MADE FOR R.L.""A Puerto Rican Faggot From America"" (Danspace, 1996) is a dance piece where Aviles forgoes the use of text, music, and costume, leaving the audience to interpret the movement through the dance’s title. Throughout the performance, Aviles continuously moves in time and space while asserting his racial, sexual, and national identity. He dances nude as a political gesture to critique contemporary dance aesthetics and to expose his gay, Puerto Rican body amid the AIDS crisis. Aviles also expresses tension surrounding his self-proclaimed identity as a """"New York-Rican""""—a Puerto Rican born in New York that is estranged from island language and culture. Ultimately, Aviles conjures a body politic that challenges stereotypes and phobias about gay men during the AIDS pandemic, especially in the Latino community. ""Super Maéva de Oz"" (2000) is a revised restaging of the original Maéva de Oz, in which company encircles Elizabeth Marrero's character, Maéva, while Maéva simultaneously unfolds a monologue exploring many of the characters in the Wizard of Oz, telling the story of a Latina coming out of the closet.""Ritual Dance"" (2000), in this version, features a smaller group of dancers wearing white costumes that emphasize upper body gestures as they clap and move across the floor while also performing stomping leg movements. ""How to Stay Alive"" (2000) is a solo dance of Arthur Aviles moving in a red dress to classical music, queering both gender roles and ballet form.[BIO]Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre (AATT) is a Bronx-based modern dance company committed to creating a repertoire of works that explore life on the margins of Latino and gay cultures, and to bring these works to local, national and international audiences.

Inthis iteration, Icarus's tale is less a hubristic attempt at defyinggravity and more a cautionary warning about what is enacted and sacrificedin the name of freedom. The setting is a small town near Colorado Springs,Colorado, home to the North American Air Defense Command. There, thepopulation's sole focus is on self-protection and the preservation of theNorth American continent in an aerospace battle they are certain is fastapproaching. While Icarus does achieve flight, he inevitably falls, inspite of the society's preparedness and their isolating, singular focus onself-preservation.

The infanticide became known as the Massacre of Innocents. This story runs parallel to contemporary events and the havoc wrought onthe masses by those wielding power.

Across Canada, civil liberties weresuspended as Canadian Forces patrolled Montréal streets. These eventsfueled the already-swelling Québec sovereignty movement in the decadesthat followed. Forty years later, how are these events remembered?A Measure of War (Je me souviens) is a site-specific public performance inwhich seemingly disconnected historical events and public speeches are‘remixed’––both culturally and linguistically––encouraging ourcollective amnesia to remember things as they never were. How do weunderstand Trudeau’s speech on October 16, 1970, or the FLQ Manifesto,when it is read not only in English and French––official languages of abilingual Canada––but in a third language? How do we respond to thedissonance produced by overlapping layers of conflicted histories,including the ambivalent history of multiculturalism?On October 16, 2010, the public was invited to participate in thisperformance by riding their bicycles alongside Khang’s pedal-poweredmini-tank all the way to Montréal City Hall.

In the installation/performance space of ‘Sans Gravity’, Bustamante explores the metaphors associated with water in the physical realm by burdening her body. The weight and the movement of the water develop into extensions of the gesture and another layer of the distorted self. The audience becomes a mechanism of relief. Nao Bustamante is an internationally known performance art pioneer originating from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Her work encompasses performance art, installation, video, pop music and experimental rips in time. Using the body as a source of image, narrative and emotion, her performances communicate on the level of subconscious language taking the spectator on a bizarre journey, with haunting images, cracking stereotypes by embodying them. Bustamante's work has been presented, among other sites at, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Arts, and the Kiasma Museum of Helsinki. She has performed in Galleries, Museums, Universities and underground sites throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States.

An invention that resists titles like Performance Artist, Man of God, or Anarchist -- Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping have become popular as none of the above or as all three. In one form, this project is an interactive play, an evening-length church service that seems to evolve from comedy to some sort of secular spirituality that downtown New York hipsters embrace. Working in 300-seat theaters with large gospel choirs that sing anti-consumerist lyrics (‘Stop Shopping! Stop Shopping! Now we can leave the Shopping Malls!’), the Reverend usually works, like a normal church, with a theme at each service. These range from anti-sweatshop concerns, to the neighborhood defense against the economy of tourism, to animal rights. However, Reverend Billy is best known for his Disney and Starbucks store invasions, which also combine the elements of drama, religion and politics.

A multi-media performance installation piece the artists create a participatory performance, inviting the audience to the ‘stage’, the entire gallery space. Using force and props like scissors, a pick axe and football equipment, at times physically violent, the two portray a scene relating to borders, migration and the process of globalization. La Pocha Nostra (www.pochanostra.com) is an ever-morphing trans-disciplinary arts organization, founded in 1993 by Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Roberto Sifuentes, and Nola Mariano in California. The objective was to formally conceptualize Gómez-Peña's collaborations with other performance artists.  It provides a base (and forum) for a loose network of rebel artists from various disciplines, generations and ethnic backgrounds, whose common denominator is the desire to cross and erase dangerous borders between art and politics, practice and theory, artist and spectator.  As of June 2006, members include performance artists Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Violeta Luna, Michelle Ceballos, and Roberto Sifuentes; curators Gabriela Salgado and Orlando Britto; and over thirty associates worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Spain, the UK, and Australia. Projects range from performance solos and duets to large-scale performance installations including video, photography, audio, and cyber-art. La Pocha collaborates across national borders, race, gender and generations. Their collaborative model functions both as an act of citizen diplomacy and as a means to create ‘ephemeral communities’ of like-minded rebels. The basic premise of these collaborations is founded on an ideal: If we learn to cross borders on stage, we may learn how to do so in larger social spheres. La Pocha strives to eradicate myths of purity and dissolve borders surrounding culture, ethnicity, gender, language, and métier.  These are radical acts.","Pocha Nostra| Gómez-Peña, Guillermo| Globalization & performance art| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

She is a lovelorn and timeworn artiste, a singer of torch songs, a faded night club entertainer. She is a convicted murderer serving the last days of her sentence at Oso Blanco penitentiary. She is also, biologically speaking, a male. The writer dispenses with pieties on this issue — Loca’s biology is not a scandal but a fact. Loca disputes the notion that an aging male body is no home for a lady. She is vulgar, sentimental, sweet, and always sharp as a tack. She remains loyal to the memory of her beloved Nene Lindo, his brand of tough love, and his inscrutable beauty. Her crime binds them forever in shame and passion.’ Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org). , founded in 1979 in New York City, is dedicated to creating innovative and challenging theater rooted in Puerto Rican traditions and popular artistic expressions. They have performed in 21 states as well as internationally.

Based on Luis Enríquez & Sergio Bardotti’s ‘Los Saltimbanquis’ and the Brothers Grimm’s classic fairy tale ‘The Town Musicians of Bremen,’ the performance tells the story of the journey of four musician animals from four different regions of Peru: an Afro-Peruvian hen ('La Plumosa'), a donkey from the Southern plains ('El Burro'), a cat from the rainforest region ('La Michicha'), and a dog from the Northern coastal area ('El Chusco'). The animals abandon their hometowns in search of their dreams in the capital city; upon meeting each other along the way, and after many adventures and exploits, they decide to form a music group, the ‘Músicos Ambulantes’ (‘Traveling Musicians’), and to tour the country telling their multiethnic story. The resulting performance, by now a classic piece in Yuyachkani’s repertoire (performed since 1983), is a popular musical theater celebration of Peruvian cultural and ethnic diversity. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theatre as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theatre,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.","Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani| Peru Ethnic diversity| Bremen town musicians| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

The performance aims to illustrate the contradictory aspects of mestizaje in which the genocide and rape of one race led to the creation of a new race. Furthermore, it looks to redefine mestizaje to incorporate mixed race and queer identities, portraying subversive yet fluid identities to dismantle the binaries created by colonial constructs relating to race and gender. Theories of contact between ancient civilizations and extraterrestrials influenced the performance artist's vision of a cosmic mestizaje in which the impending transformation of the world as we know it may lead to possibilities for the creation of a new existence and way of being. Gigi Otálvaro-Hormillosa, also known as the Devil Bunny in Bondage, is a San Francisco based interdisciplinary performance artist, video artist, cultural activist, curator and percussionist of Filipino and Colombian descent. She is originally from Miami, Florida and received her B.A. from Brown University where she created an independent concentration entitled 'Hybridity and Performance.' She is currently the Artistic Director of (a)eromestiza, an interdisciplinary arts organization dedicated to presenting experimental video and performance work by queer and/or people of color. She has also worked with non-profit organizations such as Proyecto ContraSIDA Por Vida, New Langton Arts, Galería de la Raza, the Queer Cultural Center, Asian American Theater Company and the Asian Pacific Islander Cultural Center. She has worked on various artistic collaborations under the mentorship and direction of performing artists such as Pearl Ubungen, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Elia Arce and Afia Walking Tree. Her work in performance, video and writing has been presented nationally and internationally.

An awakening call to the body led by, and oppressed by, globalization. Fabião explains, ‘The experience of being a ‘world citizen’ in the era of globalization produces on me, among many advantages and benefits, a disturbing vertigo, a certain existential dizziness.   I am permanently experiencing a tension provoked by the expansion of my body through all communication and transportation systems, and the dispersion of my self while perceiving the vast-virtual world’s web.  There is a centrifugal force expanding the body towards space and time, and a centripetal force condensing body and space in a timeless state. ‘Giro Piece’ is a performance art work that investigates these issues using maps (all kinds: sky maps, world maps, human body maps, subway maps…),four televisions, saliva, a dress, a woman-performer and the spectators’ presence and movement.’ Performance artist and theorist Eleonora Fabião focuses strongly on the relationship between the audience and performer, using ‘co-labor-a(c)tion’ to break down the standard active-passive dichotomy. The main thrust of her work is directed towards an exploration of the ‘poetic body’ and its creative, political and communicative abilities.","Fabião, Eleonora| Performance art| Globalization and the body| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theater, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.","Correa, Ana| Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani| Cultural performance Peru| Hemispheric Institute| Globalization, Migration and the Public Sphere","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

In a direct comment on the Americanmusical 'Evita,' Rodríguez proposes an 'alternative' history of Duarte dePerón's final days and the ultimate disposal of her corpse, playfullyclashing historic, real, fictional, virtual and anachronistic conceptionsof time and place.  'In the face of Latin America's current social,economic, and political crisis, in an era of globalization and profoundimpasses, we can't help but ask ourselves a pressing question: who was EvaPerón, and what happened to her corpse?': a satiric comment on Westernsociety's priorities, meshed with original and traditional tangos andmilongas (performed by 'el Gaucho del Wonder Bra' Liliana Felipe), thesequestions articulate the piece as a set of three interconnected skits.  Theperformance starts with a radio show featuring biographies of key femalepublic figures in Latin America (sponsored by 'Jabón Radical' ('RadicalSoap,' which 'cleans and reestablishes social order').  The second segmentis the enacted story of the 'final events' in Evita's life: Eva (performedby Rodríguez) bought a radio station to counteract her detractors' versionsof her life and death, and 'reenacts' her final days with the aid of her mother(who is about to give birth to President Carlos Menem, and wants to get theaccess code to Evita's bank accounts), a nurse, and a foley assistant.  Thethird and final skit takes us to a Mexico City's Customs office, wherecorruption, drug dealing, and political coups brew, resulting in a changeof government that intends to use Evita's body (held in customs on its wayto the U.S., where Madonna intended to use it as a promotional object forher movie) as sorts of flag for the 'incorruptibility' of the new 'nationalbody.'

Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodríguez has been called the most important woman of Mexico. Often referred to as a ‘chameleon,’ Rodríguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her ‘espectáculos’ (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and ‘carpa,’ to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. She seeks to render corporal and, thus, visible, the tensions between the discourses in operation on and through the individual and collective body. Rodriguez’s energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. Liliana Felipe, one of Latin America's foremost singers and composers, was born in Argentina in the 1950s. She left for Mexico just before the outbreak of the 'Dirty War' (1976), but her sister and brother-in-law were both 'disappeared'--victims of the military dictatorship's criminal politics. Liliana's music has a wide following in Latin America. She continues to be a powerful presence in Argentina, working with human rights organizations--especially H.I.J.O.S. (the organization of the children of the disappeared). In Mexico, Liliana went to one of Jesusa Rodríguez's performances. Jesusa, catching a glimpse of Felipe in the audience, remembers saying to herself: ‘I am going to die with that woman.’ Since then, Liliana and Jesusa have created two performance spaces, El Cuervo and later El Hábito in Coyoacán, Mexico City, that they still run. They 'married' in February 2000.

It intends to explore, recuperate and document the corporeal, vocal andmusical characteristics of Mexico's popular archetypes present in thecollective imagery and rooted in the tradition of satiric lithography asdeveloped at the end of the XIX century by artists like José MaríaVillasana, Daniel Cabrera, José Guadalupe Posada and Constantino Escalante,among others.  The result, a sorts of Mexican Commedia dell'Arte -withimprovisational twists and turns aiming to evidence vices in socialconduct- is less an archaeological 'reconstruction' than a humorous,satiric reenactment and actualization of these archetypes in the context ofcurrent sociopolitical events in the public sphere.  Some archetypicalcharacters -depicted in masks created by Sheila Goloborotko- are: 'El Hijodel Ahuizote' (the persecuted and censored journalist), 'Doña CaralampiaMondongo' (the spirit of criticism), 'Don Catrín de la Fachenda' (thepretentious deceiver),  'La Jamona' (the socialite old maid, stalker ofyoung men), 'El Dictador' (the figure of power and authoritarism), 'ElPadre Cobos' (the anticlericalist), 'El Maromero' (the exploitativepolitician who, no matter what, is always back on his feet), 'El Lépero'(the eternal underdog, the moral contagium), 'El Pulque' (the folkloricembodiment of inspiration), 'El Pelado' (the builder of the nation), 'LaChina' (the brave townswoman), and 'El Cuico' (the roguish policeman).

In 'a land far, faraway, in a big city affected by the citizens' carelessness, but that thanks to thegovernment... was totally devastated,' a little girl with an 'uncanny'resemblance to President Salinas meets a vagabond who gives her terriblenews: a dangerous giant ('a subproduct of civil indignation for electoralfraud') approaches the city intending to rebel from the abuses ofpolitical tyranny.

With theaid of three magic talismans, they dodge the villains' repeated attacks, butEscaldufa ultimately outsmarts them by dressing up like 'the NAFTA fairy.'She proposes the girl to barter the control of all the hemisphere inexchange for an elixir that erases any political 'mishandling.' Sealed theagreement, the girl makes a public speech promising to magically transformMexico into a First World country, but instead wishes for hair and pours theelixir over her bald head, emptying the bottle in the process. With nomore elixir to transform the country, the girl resorts to the argument that 'itis not with exotic formulas that the country will improve, we requirepatience, strength, unity.' Cachirulo, indignant, interrupts the political speech,silencing the girl and ending the story.

Saxophonist Jim Pepper (b. 1941 - d. 1992) a Creek and Kaw Indian was an innovative jazz musician who made his mark in the United States and in Europe.   His unique style fused Native American Church music and powwow music with the experimental jazz.  His best know work, ‘Pepper's Pow Wow,’ was released in 1971.  Pepper was a big influence on Muscogee poet Joy Harjo, and collaborated with the Native women's a cappella group, Ulali. He was inducted into the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame posthumously after his tragic death following his battle with lymphoid cancer.  Pepper is remembered for his contribution to both the Jazz scene and the Native music scene, and for expanding the perceptions and expectations of both genres.

These differences, coupled with the illegal and unjust taking of Indian land have over the years led to many Indian land claims against the United States government. In 1946 Congress created the Indian Land Claims Commission to adjudicate the overwhelming number of cases Indians had filed and were continuing to file. By the time the commission expired thirty-three years later more than a half billion dollars had been awarded.  Nevertheless many cases remain pending and many others have yet to be filed.   Dr. Venables explains this complicated history and examines both the historical and contemporary issues and the legal relationship between the tribes and U.S. government.  Although the primary focus is on the Haudenausaunee (Iroquois) his talk includes issues concerning all tribes specifically, citizenship, Indian-to-Indian relationships, and the government's relationship with the tribes today.

This episode contains performances by the SilverCloud Singers, an inter-tribal drum group whose members are a part of the Native community of New York City. The SilverClouds perform traditional Native American pow-wow songs and demonstrate three different styles of dances popular at today's pow-wows.  Also featured in this episode are the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. The SilverCloud Singers are an intertribal Native American singing & dance troupe weaving the traditional with the contemporary of Native song & dance. SilverCloud was founded in 1991 and takes its name in tribute of Josephine Mofsie Tarrant, the mother of founding members Kevin Tarrant and Michael Tarrant, and current members Donald Tarrant and Judy Tarrant Fields. The singers of SilverCloud come from many tribes, and from many parts of the U.S and Canada. The group was started with the intention of using traditional methods of Native culture as a means to educate through song and dance. The Thunderbird American Indian Dancers traces its roots back to a group of teenagers called the Little Eagles, which included director Louis Mofsie.  Each member had a very distinct and different cultural background and as a group they were determined to first learn and preserve the songs and dances of their own tribes and then to branch out to include those of other tribes. As adults, the Little Eagles transformed themselves into the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.  Today, the Thunderbird’s annual powwow, performance, and auction raise critical scholarship money for Indian students. Now over 30 years old, the group brings the beauty of traditional Native American culture to both American Indian and non-Indian audiences. Specializing in a variety of distinct regional tribal dances, their performances are wonderfully presented with narrative stories.

Cánepa befriends a ‘Qolla’ (a comic Andean dancer), who lends him his body and his voice so that he could tell his story. The play is performed around a platform that supports pieces of clothing, according to the Andean custom that lays them in wake, eight days after the death of a relative, as a final farewell ritual. During the years of political terror of Peru’s Dirty War this ritual has been transformed as the only way to bid farewell to the souls of the departed when their bodies have been disappeared by the military. Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy.

The performers, characters Abelardo and Amanda, try to recapture their act, their identities, their audience and a grip on life.

Due to the war, these three caretakers—the only survivors of the town—have been unable to honor their patron saint for many years. For the Hispanic Mayordomo and his mestiza employee, Bernardina, the procession would restore order and bring meaning back to their lives. Yet, for the subaltern indigenous character, Rufino, to honor Santiago would betray his cultural identity. Rufino thus decides to adopt the language, masks, and clothes of an Andean trickster deity in order to betray the attempt to restage the procession. As the program notes explain, during la Reconquista the figure of Santiago was transformed from a peaceful follower of Christ into the Moor-slaying Patron of Spain; in the Conquest, he became a killer of Indians. Ironically, Catholicism's colonizing force turned Santiago into the holy patron of many Peruvian towns, venerated by the largely native and mestizo population. This production suggests that, although forgotten by most Peruvians, a syncretic connection between Santiago and the Andean god Yllapa motivated this odd veneration. The piece merges dream with reality, past with present, as the memories of the earlier peninsular Reconquest allegorize both the Spanish Conquest of America and the recent guerilla war that ravaged the country for decades.

The play is weaved around two words: Love and Utopia --be it the Utopia of Love or the Love for Utopia. A long-time couple kills time by putting themselves in extreme situations in order to overcome boredom and safeguard their love. They leave home and wander from run-down hotel to run-down hotel, confronting every day as if it was their very first. This piece is an exploration on the world of romantic couples, an investigation on love, encounters and disencounters, communication and miscommunication, presence and absence. Far from portraying a linear storyline, it shows a broad spectrum of sensations and relationships for and with the spectators, so that it is them who ultimately piece together the elements at play through the lens of their own experiences and references regarding love, human relations, solitude, solidarity, disenchantment and hope.

One of the most important contributors to the ‘Escena Avanzada’,CADA incorporated strategies of theatricality and performance as anessential element to all its ‘art actions’, while questioning thepractices and institutions of all politics and conceiving art as anecessary social practice that eradicated the traditional distance betweenthe artist and the spectator. Committed to the foundation of an open andspontaneous practice of spectatorship, their ‘interventions in everydaylife’ intended to interrupt and alter the normalized routines of thedaily urban life of the citizen, by means of a semiotic subversion thatdecontextualized and semantically restructured urban behaviors, locationsand signs. On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milkfactory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previouslyplanned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where thetrucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connectsa milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. Thisconnection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum bycovering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought toexpose political violence, cultural censorship, and human misery in acountry threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’sdictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so themilk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology andPinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist politicalrepression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk plant packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of parked trucks in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. The artists at its front door spread a large white cloth in order to cover the entrance. They haul down the Chilean flag.","Colectivo Acciones de Arte (CADA)| Inversión de escena| Dictatorship Chile -Augusto Pinochet| Art and politics| Civil rights activism","CADA (Colectivo Acciones de Arte)",,

On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milkfactory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previouslyplanned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where thetrucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connectsa milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. Thisconnection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum bycovering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought toexpose political violence, cultural censorship, and human misery in acountry threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’sdictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so themilk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology andPinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist politicalrepression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk plant packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of parked trucks in front of the Museum of Fine Arts. The artists at its front door spread a large white cloth in order to cover the entrance.

This was meant as an open text to becompleted by the citizens, according to their specific social demands (Nomore __). CADA invited Chilean artists from different fields to spread thismessage on walls all over Santiago. The slogan was soon used by differentcollectives all over the country as a massive public symbol of politicalresistance and non-conformity. This documentary shows a series ofinterviews with Chilean intellectuals reflecting on the centrality of CADAfor the resistance to the Pinochet dictatorship. The interviewees (MilanIvelic, Nelly Richard, José Joaquín Brunner and Eugenia Brito) talkabout the rupturist character of CADA vis-à-vis the Chilean artestablishment, posing an interpenetration of art, politics and socialcritique in their work, and branding CADA as fundamental to the developmentof a field of political resistance and critical thinking among intellectuals.","Colectivo Acciones de Arte (CADA)| No +| Dictatorship Chile -Augusto Pinochet| Art and politics| Civil rights activism","CADA (Colectivo Acciones de Arte)",,

On October 17, 1979, eight milk trucks left the Soprole milkfactory to drive through the city of Santiago according to a previouslyplanned route, which ended at the National Museum of Fine Arts, where thetrucks stood for hours forming a long line. The route symbolically connectsa milk producing factory with a conservative 'art factory', the museum. Thisconnection is further performed by closing the entrance to the Museum bycovering the façade with a large white cloth. This civil action sought toexpose political violence, cultural censorship and human misery in acountry threatened and under surveillance by Augusto Pinochet’sdictatorship. The Museum was under the control of the dictatorship so themilk trucks worked as a critical reference to military technology andPinochet’s regime. The white cloth sought to evoke and resist politicalrepression; it indicated that art was not inside the museum but outside,dispersed in the city, clandestine. Here shown is the productive 'backstage' of the action: the workers at the milk factory packaging the milk and the milk trucks driving through the city. Then we see the long line of trucks parked in front of the Museum of Fine Arts.

Fulana used The Virgin of Guadalupe to comment on the commodification of religion, as her image is everywhere: on t-shirts, postcards, key chains, handbags, designer jeans, etc.; she has become a hipster-friendly Latina Virgin superstar. Juan Diego, the indigenous man to whom this Virgin first appeared, has recently made it to sainthood, but he has been 'whitened' in the Vatican's official image, which erases his indigenous traits and makes him look like a Spaniard. This is reminiscent of the whitening of Latina/o pop stars when they 'make it' in the music industry ( e.g. Shakira). Rewriting J-Lo's pop hit, 'Jenny from the Block,' this video stages the 'creation' of Saint Juan Diego by mafia-sounding Vatican intelligence (the Pope and music producer Emilio Estefan). Knowing the Catholic Church is in crisis, losing many of their flock to Evangelicals, they decide to canonize Juan Diego to attract the Latino market. Mr. Estefan gives Juan Diego a 'cross-over make-over' and the Pope canonizes him on the spot. JuanDi is thrilled by his transformation, but the Virgin admonishes him for having sold out. As the song progresses, their fighting becomes more intense, their egos take over, and they eventually alienate their supporters, who go off with an Evangelical couple who knocks at their door.

In this interview, conducted in the context of the celebration of the International Women's Day, Peirano, Correa and Ralli discuss the role of women in Peruvian theater. Topics covered include women’s role in society, the difficulty of making a living as professional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists’work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection about these roles, a creative realm where to play with and challenge them.  For Ralli and Correa, theater has been a space for personal growth, aesthetic exploration, and social intervention.  The artists discuss the interplay between their workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issues of sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances, and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internal workings of Yuyachkani and with their audience.  This program includes clips from ‘La Primera Cena’ (one of Yuyachkani’s plays) and the Encuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought together various Peruvian femaleperformers of Peru). Teresa Ralli also discusses her role in Yuyachkani’s play ‘Músicos Ambulantes,’ and the role women artists play in the creation and performance of her piece ‘Antígona.’ Peru’s most important theatre collective, Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani (www.yuyachkani.org) has been working since 1971 at the forefront of theatrical experimentation, political performance, and collective creation. ‘Yuyachkani’ is a Quechua word that means ‘I am thinking, I am remembering’; under this name, the theatre group has devoted itself to the collective exploration of embodied social memory, particularly in relation to questions of ethnicity, violence, and memory in Peru. The group is comprised of seven actors (Augusto Casafranca, Amiel Cayo, Ana Correa, Débora Correa, Rebeca Ralli, Teresa Ralli, and Julián Vargas), a technical designer (Fidel Melquíades), and an artistic director (Miguel Rubio), who have made a commitment to collective creation as a mode of theatrical production and to group theater as a life style. Their work has been among the most important in Latin America’s so called ‘New Popular Theater,’ with a strong commitment to grass-roots community issues, mobilization, and advocacy. Yuyachkani won Peru’s National Human Rights Award in 2000. Known for its creative embrace of both indigenous performance forms as well as cosmopolitan theatrical forms, Yuyachkani offers insight into Peruvian and Latin American theatre, and to broader issues of postcolonial social aesthetics.","Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani| Women, theater and performance| Women performing artists| Women Peru| Theater Peru","Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani",,

Ms. Ralli discussesthe artistic training of her body and her voice as well as her approach to character development.  Teresa demonstrates that bodytraining stresses body memory, composition and accumulation.  In terms ofvoicework, Ralli discusses the need to find an 'organic' voice and theimportance of vocal interpretation; she also demonstrates the importance ofbreath in voicework.  Ms. Ralli believes actors must give the voice a task, ause of the text, and should take the voice out of its 'normal space.' To demonstrate the leap from ordinary to extra-ordinary uses of voice and text, the artist imitates popular Peruvian chants such as slogans commonly used by streetvendors; in this demonstration, Ralli switches languages, from English to Spanish to Quechua (anindigenous language of Peru which is rarely spoken by people from outside indigenous communities, but has been consistently incorporated in Yuyachkani’s work, turning into one ofthe ensemble's distinguishing elements). This pedagogical demonstration also includes object manipulation work, including exercises that explorethe weight, balance and center of diverse objects.  In order to illustrate herresearch on the subject, Ralli includes a demonstration of her work withchairs, which is a fundamental part of the Yuyachkani technique inobject-work.  Finally, the artist shows the audience some aspects ofcharacter development, demonstrating diverse stages in the creation of oneof her characters, ‘El Chusco,' featured in ‘MúsicosAmbulantes,’ a musical spectacle created by Yuyachkani in 1983 andstill performed today.  Weight, balance, volume, flows of energy andcenters of balance, showcased in this demonstration, are central aspects inYuyachkani’s (re)search of what they term an ‘actor múltiple’ or‘multiple actor,’ a performer who explores and embodies the interplay between technique and sensitive/bodily memory.

After the fall of the Fujimori Presidency in 2001, theextent of governmental corruption and its key players were being exposed, by means of documentation which demonstrated that members of Fujimori’s Cabinet hadaccepted bribes, in addition to embezzling a great amount of money duringhis presidency.  In this street action, members of Yuyachkani perform acritique to the abuses of power and the financial corruption that tookplace within Fujimori's government: the actors dance to the well-known ‘El bailedel Chino’ (a ‘tecnocumbia’ song used by Fujimori for his thirdelectoral campaign), wearing masks to represent some of these politicalfigures, including Fujimori, Montesinos, the Mayor, the Minister, aCongresswoman, a representative of Judicial Power, the Assessor, Owners ofMass-Communication, the Military and the Grupo Colina (a paramilitarygroup).  The group toured around Lima in a small bus which they called‘El Bus de la Fuga’ (‘Escape Bus’), from Barrios Altos (a neighborhood that suffered the murder to some of its residents) to La Cantuta (where a number of studentswere murdered) to Tokyo (where President Fujimori fled to exile).  Theroute covered both affluent and impoverished neighborhoods of Peru’s capital city-including the Palacio de Justicia, the Distrito de Comas, the ParqueUniversitario, the Universidad Nacional de Educación, Ate-Vitarte, Villael Salvador, and Miraflores- eliciting the most varied reactions dependingon where the street action was performed.

Three friends meet upto cook and share a supper on the last day of the last year of the XXthcentury, honoring a pact made twenty years before.  Only two of theoriginal three friends arrive (the third, a militant worker for humanrights, has been murdered); in her place, her daughter (played by LuciaLora) arrives to honor the pact made by her mother.  All three women are indifferent stages in their lives.  The first character (played by AnaCorrea) was the top of her class in High School but, upon graduation, shequickly married and had five kids who are her entire life now.  The secondcharacter (played by Rebecca Ralli) realized her High School dreams bybecoming an artist, but stopped painting when she entered into a badmarriage ten years after graduation.  The third character, the daughter ofthe third friend, is resentful because, although her mother had time forthe rights of other children, she feels that she never had time for her. The three women revisit their lives and the moments they feel that changedthe course of their destiny.  They decide that this will be the firstsupper (‘la primera cena’) of their new lives.  In the middle ofdinner, the ‘Goddess of the Kitchen’ appears (in this play, the kitchenfunctions as a metaphor for life); the characters revalue the knowledge andwisdom of women (in the context of the space of the kitchen), ultimatelyinviting the audience to share their first supper with them by eating thesoup they were actually cooking on stage.

Correa believes thatthe body is an actor's instrument; in this pedagogical demonstration she focuses onher body work and her work with objects in the development of a character. Among the diverse elements of body work, Correa shows: the importance ofmoving the body through space in different ways and at different speeds;the importance of feeling your weight in the space; and how to make musical‘phrases’ with your body, and how to play with the timing of the phraseand manipulate it.  The demonstration also includes an example of how theactress incorporates Tai-chi into her character development – Tai chibeing an important methodology for exploring and developing bodilyexpressivity for Yuyachkani.  The lecture also includes mask work, as Anashows how the mask takes on its own identity, how the masked charactermoves, and how it responds to various objects.  Correa also discussesthe balance between text work and body work.  One of the elements of bodywork she demonstrates is dance, in particular the use of tap dance to learnhow to play with timing.  Ms. Correa goes over the creation of one of hercharacters, ‘Po Po’ the clown.  Part of her methodology for creatingthis character included playing with musical instruments (in the case of‘Po Po’, an accordion), not only as instruments per se but also as performingobjects; special attention is paid to the exploration of how toexpress emotions with and through them.

Presented as afairytale-gone-wrong (presented by Cachirulo, legendary children’s TVcharacter by Enrique Alonso, and ‘betwitched’ by Cachirulo’s TVcharacters Bruja Escaldufa and Fanfarrón), the piece poses ananti-Establishment take on the agrarian reforms proposed by then PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari (through his controversial Ammendment to Article27 of Mexico's Constitution). These reforms directly affected theorganizational units known as ‘ejidos’ –hence the Spanish pun between‘el ejido’ (‘the ejido’) and ‘elegido’ (‘the Chosen One’, aChristian epithet common in Nativity plays).  Corruption, embezzlement andpolitical violence roam rural Mexico while legendary political figures andfictional characters visit an impoverished, disempowered peasant couple. The constant abuses, endured patiently by the peasantry and indigenouspeoples, evidence how political promises of progress and of inclusion inthe ‘national project’ end up as nightmares of oppression for millionsof Mexicans through history.

In a ‘phenomenology offortuitous becoming', the universe is portrayed as 'a palenque whereanything could happen’, and Mexican electoral processes as a 'gamble'.  Inthis vein, and interspersed with parodic renditions of traditional folksongs by Rodríguez and ‘sexy ranchera’ Isela Vega (a famous Mexicanvedette),  the audience is invited to play a satirical Mexican‘lotería’ (with cards like ‘The Wetback’, ‘The Zapatista’,‘The First Lady’, and ‘The ATM’ substituting the traditional iconsof this popular game) and to gamble, control, and judge an electoral‘cockfight’ where puppets of political candidates race to be the firstto reach the finishing line of Mexico's presidency.

These TWO ROWS willsymbolize vessels, traveling down the same river together.  One will be forthe Original People, their laws, their customs, and the other for theEuropean people and their laws and customs. We will each travel the rivertogether, but each in our own boat. And neither of us will try to steer theother's vessel.'  The Haudenosaunee has kept the agreement to this date. Alan's artwork is also in the film and his show can be seen at http://www.nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/newtribe/.","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics| Michelson, Alan| Indigenous performance| Native American artists| Two Row Wampum Treaty","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

The discussion leads toEyre’s landmark film ‘Smoke Signals’ and the direction the success ofthe film took him personally and professionally.  The success of this filmlead the artist to a feeling of greater responsibility to represent and togain knowledge about other tribes since he became an involuntaryspokesperson for Native people. As a filmmaker at the beginning of his career, interviewer Andrew McLean(Inupik) directed several questions to Eyre about negotiating the filmworld as a minority producer. Chris acknowledged the existing pressures tobe ‘issue oriented’ and stated that the fact that a Native person wason film makes it a political piece.  Eyre reflects on some of his filmssuch as ‘Skins’ (which he made to illustrate the poverty on the PineRidge reservation, and consequently did not have a successful run), andcontrasted it with his character-driven films such as ‘Smoke Signals’and ‘Edge of America,’ which have a more universal appeal. FinallyChris relays Andrew, who come form a whaling Nation, his excitement aboutan upcoming project on the Makah Whale hunt that took place in May 17, 1999at Neah Bay.","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics| Eyre, Chris, | Native filmmakers| Smoke signals (Motion picture)| Indigenous performance","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

Interviewswith La Máscara’s founder and director Lucy Bolaños, playwright PilarRestrepo, and spokesperson of the ‘Red Nacional de Mujeres’ NormaBermúdez give context to the contributions of La Máscara to thedevelopment and acknowledgment of Colombian women’s creative languages,while advocating for a culture of peace through the strengthening ofalternative imaginaries of solidarity and equality. Teatro La Máscara isthe oldest -and one of the only- feminist, all-women’s theater inColombia. Founded in 1972 in Cali, La Máscara was a political theaterinitially comprised of male as well as female actors; by the early 1980s,when only the women stayed and wanted to continue the theatrical trajectoryof the group, Lucy Bolaños decided to make La Máscara a women’sensemble fully dedicated to a feminine dramaturgy on gender issues.Committed to feminism and social change, they have stayed true to thismission, despite the many social and economic pressures they’ve had toendure in an environment plagued by violence and machismo, which constantlyseeks to ‘invisibilize’ their work. Because of their fruitfulstubbornness, La Máscara is not only creating and staging plays, but alsoworking with marginalized communities, actively participating in politicalprotests and demonstrations, and being involved in the organization oftheater festivals.

He isgoing to be beheaded but he does not know when.

Theprisoner is alternatively visited by the warden’s daughter, his ownmother, a new inmate, and by the warden; even a group of ghosts or visionshaunts him. Amidst the nightmarish, carnivalesque ebbs and flows ofvisitors, the protagonist acts as a deluded philosopher. He alternatesobsessive references to the date of his execution with deep (albeit weird)philosophical reflections. Faithful to their traditional exploration ofmarginal subjects, La Candelaria chooses as main character a trueanti-hero, an underdog trapped in the power games of society.

The truthis it is a kind of no-place surrounded by violence and social conflicts.The characters constantly refer to issues from the outside as ifpolitical violence and other danger exist only outside, and the bar was ahaven.

The playalso shows the connections between theater and political interests andpressures (the group is the National Company of Theater). The directorhires a group of Indigenous people to perform as Indians from the time ofthe Conquest. They refuse to perform without being paid and so the playbecomes a mess. This is the first in a series of disturbances (most of themassociated with political issues) that interrupts and threatens to ruin therehearsals and the debut of the piece.

When Patricia Ariza visited Urabá, a region in Colombia, shetalked to a group of women who could not bury their dead husbands, killedin the civil war. She connected this awful situation to the myth ofAntigone and read it to the collective. This version of La Candelariainvolves a series of transformations to the original myth. At thebeginning, we see Tiresias walking around an empty space; taking the placeof the chorus, he gives the audience the historical context, recountingbackground events that are important for a proper understanding of theplay. The play presents three Antigones and two Ismenes who discuss thepossibility of violating Creonte’s rules in order to bury their brothersaccording to tradition. The discussion is thus polyphonic.

As a soloartist, she produces her work since 1991 through her organization‘Producciones Teresa, no Inc.’. She also offers workshops, talks andperformance demonstrations for high school and college students. Teresa’screative projects are characterized by a consistent eschewing oftraditional artistic categories. Theater, dance, performance, dramatictext, movement, costumes, video and everyday objects are juxtaposed andconfronted, placed in a liminal space where notions of precariousness areexplored and celebrated. Teresa’s characters explore and expose theanxieties of everyday life in Puerto Rican society, transversallyinvestigating issues of gender, class and race. In this interview, theartist talks about her coined term ‘stage artist’ (vis-à-vis‘perfomer’, ‘actress’ or ‘dancer’) in the light of hermultifaceted training and artistic trajectory. Teresa explains the role ofthe ‘taller’ (workshop) as a format and context for artistic creation. She talksabout approximation, appropriation and precariousness as organizingcoordinates of her artistic work. Hernández also discusses the creationand transformation of her characters, the use of costumes and everydayobjects as stimuli for creation, the exploits of being an experimentalartist in Puerto Rico, and her -at the time of the interview- upcomingproject ‘Nada Que Ver (Composiciones Escénicas Sobre el Yo)’.","Hernández, Teresa| Performing arts Puerto Rico| Women in the performing arts| Experimental methods in the arts| Creative process in the arts","Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

The Giramundo piece features puppets created in the style oftraditional Carajá craftsmanship and inspired by popular art from Northernand Northeastern Brazil. Created in 1970 by Brazilian artists ÁlvaroApocalypse, Terezinha Veloso and Maria do Carmo Vivacqua Martins (Madu),Giramundo Teatro de Bonecos (www.giramundo.org) has gained worldwiderecognition as one of the most important puppet theater groups in theworld. Their remarkable trajectory includes professional works for theater,film, video, and television, as well as a strong pedagogical component,teaching workshops and puppetry courses both abroad and in their own schoolin Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Every year, besides setting up a new show, thegroup works on a remake. The 950 marionettes that have already staged orthat are still on stage are part of the Museu Giramundo collection, whichhas the largest private collection of the kind in Brazil. At the Museum wecan also find the Coleção de Desenhos e Estudos para Teatro, withsketches and outlines for set design, and the models of the group´screators. The methodological rigor in creating their performances, therefined construction and manipulation of their performing objects, andtheir interest in exploring topics in Brazilian culture have providedGiramundo with tools for transcending traditional children’s theater inorder to incorporate adult themes and cultural forms in direct dialoguewith complex political and aesthetic issues.546 bb $a Portuguese653 bb $a Cobra Norato653 bb $a Giramundo Teatro de Bonecos653 bb $a Puppet Theater653 bb $a Folklore Brazil Amazonas653 bb $a Performing Heritage655 b0 $a Performances655 b0 $a Theater655 b0 $a Puppet TheaterRIGHTS HOLDER INFORMATION: Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics",,

A theater piece on memory, atrocity, affect andresistance, ‘Pulpos’ bridges time (from a mythical time to the ‘BabyBoomers’ to the ‘Generation X’), and place (with an Andean textrendered Caribbean, adapted to the Puerto Rican reality) in order todenounce political repression, police brutality, ideological persecutionand political assassination, and to evoke and pay homage to our dead anddisappeared. An organizing image is that of the ‘velorio’ or wake for alost child, (alluding to the canonical Puerto Rican painting by FranciscoOller and to a contemporary rendition by Rafael Trelles), in an explorationof memories of loss and a sense of community, of a broader Puerto Ricanfamily. The recurring motif of the sea shore opens productivelayers of signification, rhythm and spatial organization: it hints to thewaters where Argentineans were ‘disappeared’ during the dictatorship,the island of Puerto Rico's (geographic and political) borders, and to the Beatles' song ‘Octopus’ Garden’, which inspires thepiece’s title. The resulting performance is an open call to rescue andsafeguard collective memories of political and historical events that haveshaped our present Latin American societies. It is also an artistic attemptto capture and evoke the sensorial complexities of past events, claimingthem as genealogical landmarks in our current collective life.

This video documents their piece ‘It’s a Small House and We've Lived in it Always’. In it, two explorers lay claim to the same territory. With three chairs as its only props, little speech, some song and much meaningful movement and expressive acting, the piece shows longtime cohabitants engaged in a contest for space. These people have known each other for a long time. They occupy a house the size of a small stage, a house divided and subdivided by time and bad habits.  They sit on the porch, watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change.  Their only hope is an audience. As they move apart and then together, spurn advances and accept closeness, mime rejection and flirtation and reveal need, the two performers enact the ebb and flow of a universally resonant relationship. This work was first commissioned by the South Bank Center as part of theBritish Festival of Visual Theatre. This video documents its NY premiere at La Mama, in the context of the show ‘Double Agency’, the first collaboration between Split Britches and the renowned English troupe The Clod Ensemble.

In 1981, it was adapted into a featurefilm for Universal Films. ‘Zoot Suit’ is based on the 1942 ‘SleepyLagoon’ murder mystery and the Zoot Suit Riots that occurred in LosAngeles after that.  The riots took place in the racially chargedenvironment of Los Angeles where sailors, soldiers and marines returningfrom World War II came into conflict with local Mexican zoot suiters. OnJune 3, 1943 a group of servicemen alleged they had been assaulted by agroup of Pachucos, Mexican American youth who had their own subcultureduring the 1930s and 40s in the American Southwest. They wore distinctiveclothing, such as zoot suits, and spoke a dialect, Calo, which isrepresented in this ETC production; they were often associated with gangactivity. A larger group of servicemen gathered in the center of theMexican community in Los Angeles where they attacked men wearing zootsuits. The police responded by arresting Mexican American youths, who hadbeen attacked in the riots, for disturbing the peace. ETC's ‘Zoot Suit’combines fact and fiction to show the fate of twenty-two Mexican Americans broughtto trial for a murder they did not commit. The character of Henry Reyna isbased upon real-life zoot suiter Henry Leyvas, who was tried and wrongfullyconvicted of first-degree murder of Jose Diaz in 1942 (the Sleepy Lagoonmurder).

The piece began as a five-week workshop in ETC's San JuanBautista playhouse in the summer of 1982, exploring the stories andnarrative lyrics of Mexican popular ballads or ‘corridos’. The workshopproduction was an instant popular success with audiences and critics. ETCdecided to stage a new production of ‘Corridos’ at the Marines MemorialTheater in San Francisco, where it ran for three months to great reviewsand eleven Bay Area Critics Awards. Other stagings followed in 1984.‘Corridos’ finally evolved into a full-fledged video production in1987, after several drafts of the script that not only reworked theselection of ballads, but also condensed the material to fit into theconfines of a one-hour special. The production presents two full-length‘corridos’: ‘Delgadina’ (a haunting parable of incest in a wealthyMexican family), and ‘Soldadera’ (based on the dispatches of Americanjournalist John Reed, in which the compelling story of Elizabeta is framedby three songs of women during the 1910 Mexican Revolution). Highlightsfrom other traditional ‘corridos’ are connected by engaging narrativesequences: ‘Yo soy El Corrido’ (the story of the ‘corrido’ itself),‘Rosita Alvirez’ (a comedic parable of a defiant young woman who meetsan early death), and ‘El Lavaplatos’ (the story of an immigrant whodreams of becoming a movie star and ends up a dishwasher). Joining membersof the original cast, the production included popular songstress LindaRonstadt, singer/actor Daniel Valdez, San Francisco Ballet artist EvelynCisneros, and actor Clancy Brown. All in all, ‘Corridos’ broke ground with a form of musical popular theater that made the transition from theater to television without losing its theatricality.

Ralli discusses the role of women in Yuyachkani in thecontext of issues of politics and gender in Peru. Topics covered includewomen’s role in society, the difficulty of making a living asprofessional female theater practitioners, and how the women artists’work with Yuyachkani provides them with a space for self-reflection aboutthese roles and also the space to play with/challenge them.  For theartist, theater has been a space for personal growth, aestheticexploration, and social intervention.  Teresa talks about the interplaybetween Yuyachkani’s workshops with Peruvian women (dealing with issuesof sensibility, bodily awareness, and memory), their theater performances,and their political activism in Peru, both in terms of the internalworkings of Yuyachkani and with their audience.  She comments on theEncuentro Nacional de Actrices (a conference/event that brought togethervarious Peruvian female performers of Peru), the celebration of the PrimerFestival Teatro Mujer (the first major theater festival by women in Peru),the creative and political environment surrounding the creation ofYuyachkani’s all-women piece ‘La primera cena’ (directed by Ralli),and the role Peruvian women play in the creation and performance of herone-woman piece ‘Antígona’.

The play was inspired by a 1984 newspaper article describing an86-year-old woman in Juarez, Mexico who was found to be carrying a60-year-old mummified fetus in her womb. Fifteen years later, playwright,director and founder of ETC Luis Valdez returned to the article whilesimultaneously embarking on a highly personal investigation of his ownfamily history. Valdez traveled to Sonora, Mexico to investigate hisfamily’s Yaqui roots and ancestral history; ‘Mummified Deer’ derivedfrom his time in Mexico and the newspaper article, in what Valdez considersto be his most personal play to date. Armida, Valdez’s mother, isre-envisioned as a young woman by the same name; his grandmothers, auntsand cousins fused into the other leading characters. The main action of theplay takes place in 1999 by the side of Mama Chu’s hospital bed, but alsoflashes back to 1969 when the Chicano Movement was just starting, backthrough the thirties and twenties, to the turn of the 20th Century and theMexican Revolution when Mama Chu crosses the border into the United States.The genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico, forcing Mama Chu to migrateto the US, is only one of the family’s buried secrets. In spite of thefluidity of time zones, what anchors all the action is the constantpresence of a young Yaqui deer dancer who dances but does not speak,symbolizing the 60-year-old mummified fetus. The play incorporates themesof family conflict within the broader context of history and socialstruggle. Staged two years after the original production at the San DiegoRepertory Theater, this version of ‘Mummified Deer’ contains severalchanges and refinements to the script.

Mendive blends significant elements of Afro-Cuban culture, creating a personal universe intimately linked to his particular worldview, one that establishes organic connections between nature and religion, African ancestry and Caribbean everyday life, a symphony of syncretism that, like all of Mendive’s art, reflects a life of commitment to African spiritual practices, a commitment that became more intense after his first visits to Africa in the early 1980s.

Cantata a los emigrantes' is a bilingual play with music celebrating the Puerto Rican pioneers who established communities in the United States and struggled for the preservation of their culture. At the time the play was created there were 2.6 million Puerto Ricans in the United States, with 1.6 million in New York alone. Puerto Ricans have been pushed and pulled ever since the United States took the island in 1898. Some have stayed and given birth to a second and third generation; some have returned to the island and others are still in never ending transit between here and there. With this collective creation, Pregones weaves through various social, historical, economical and personal factors that have influenced their migratory process. 'Migrants' is Pregones’ homage to the courage and endurance of those who came and worked before us. The play was created collectively by Pregones Theater, based on written and oral history, interviews and the works of writers such as Guillermo Boralt, René Marqués and Klemente Soto Beles. It was premiered at Pregones Theater at St. Ann’s in The Bronx, NY, in December 1986. Founded in 1979 and based in The Bronx, New York City, Pregones Theater (http://www.pregones.org) has performed in more than 400 cities and 13 countries. The company enjoys citywide recognition for their lasting contributions to the performing arts field and are recipients of numerous distinctions including current Leading National Ensemble Theatre Designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York State Governor’s Arts Award, the Culture & Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, numerous artist and production awards, as well as invitations to appear at international festivals and events. Over the years Pregones has developed a style that combines theater, music and movement, oral and written traditions, and a signature urban sensibility.

The production toured over 100 community sites in East Harlem & The Bronx in New York, and in New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The presentations were designed to promote direct audience participation in order to heighten awareness and develop sensitivity to persons with AIDS and their families.

She constantly navigates the dual identity formed by having grown up in two very different worlds: the tropical island and ‘Los Nuevayores’ (that other place away from the island.) By way of her grandmother, she is a skilled and eloquent storyteller. Her companions are two parts of the same man, one being Spanish dominant and the other English dominant. They both give life to the eternal inhabitant of the poetic world created by the writer: a Latino leading man. They are able to embody her varying definitions of manhood.

It is inspired in the tragedy of many lives lost in the Caribbean waters. Pregones infuses the playwright’s words with the company’s signature live music and physical vocabulary, and creates new characters anchored in the experience/history of Latinos in the U.S. ‘This work means a lot to us, as it addresses painful issues connected to migration. Thousands of Puerto Ricans have left Puerto Rico over the years, many other thousands have gone back. Many have been born here and with to connect with their other shore. Many don’t want to leave at all. Hundreds of Dominican, Cuban and Haitian people die as their boats sink in the Caribbean waters; many of them also make it to the other shore. Collectively, we have proven that we rise against adversity, our resistance growing each day. We hope that the play will touch our audience, and that, wherever your other shore may be, you be happy with the discovery.’ The production was premiered at the Repertory Theater of Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture in The Bronx, on June, 1996.

El Fulgor Argentino social club opens its doorsas a dance hall in 1930. The military coup that brings down the presidencyof Hipólito Yrigoyen interrupts the party. From then on, the dance hallactivities reflect the ups and downs in Argentinean history. Politicalconfrontations and military coups cut short El Fulgor’s dance party, acelebration permanently struggling to be resumed. Rhythms change, fashiontrends change, the dance is interrupted and reopened, to the beat ofhistory’s ebbs and flows. This piece is, in Catalinas Sur’s own words,an exploration of memory, not as a scientific or academic approach tohistorical events, but as an artistic attempt to recover and recreatemilestones of the community’s collective memory. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse.

El Fulgor Argentino social club opens its doorsas a dance hall in 1930. The military coup that brings down the presidencyof Hipólito Yrigoyen interrupts the party. From then on, the dance hallactivities reflect the ups and downs in Argentinean history. Politicalconfrontations and military coups cut short El Fulgor’s dance party, acelebration permanently struggling to be resumed. Rhythms change, fashiontrends change, the dance is interrupted and reopened, to the beat ofhistory’s ebbs and flows. This piece is, in Catalinas Sur’s own words,an exploration of memory, not as a scientific or academic approach tohistorical events, but as an artistic attempt to recover and recreatemilestones of the community’s collective memory. The idea of Grupo de Teatro Catalinas Sur (www.catalinasur.com.ar) came to life during a neighborhood barbeque held by a school's parents association in 1983. It was during the time of Argentina 's military dictatorship, which stifled popular expression, and the theater group used its community service as a form of resistance that strengthened feelings of solidarity and mutual binding. The group remains rooted in its Buenos Aires neighborhood, even as its membership and fame has grown, performing in a converted warehouse. Catalinas Sur members are acknowledged followers of the traditional artistic forms performed in the quarter which has been the birthplace of the popular arts: puppeteers, musicians, actors, artists originating from the old continent or from Latin America and who mingled their art, like a crucible, with the neighborhood.

Staged in a rustic, colonial home typical of the neighborhood, theinstallation was visited by more than 6,000 spectators during the lastphase of demolition in the first half of December 2003. Based on testimonyof former inhabitants, Mapa Teatro attempts to reconstruct traces of lifein found objects, photographs, sound and audio-visual display as a refugefor these fragments of memory. The installation consists of 12 physicalspaces that correspond to niches of memory of El Cartucho: 'El Testigo'(object);  'El campanero' (interactive sound);  'El escombro' (video soundinstallation); 'Los pasos' (photographic projection); 'El Carro / La báscula'(interactive installation);  'La botella' (interactive object);  'La casa'(video projection);  'La habitación' (video-sound installation);  'La piel'(sound installation);  'El fósforo' (photo installation);  'El resto'(installation); 'La voz' (sound installation). One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor. Mapa Teatro has performed by commissions, festivals and collaborative projects world-wide.","Mapa Teatro| Theater Colombia Bogotá| Performing arts Colombia| Theater and society Colombia| El Cartucho (Bogotá, Colombia) Social conditions 20th century","Rolf & Heidi Abderhalden",,

The play unravels as a journeyof a man passing through a city, a journey of thoughts and words passinginside the man's head, the passing of a story that ebbs and flows, ofhistory repeating itself, of sense lost and recovered. Voices, in theircontinuous expression and circulation, turn into the face of history andstory, their sound turned fractured gestures. And both faces and gesturesget shaped in the solitude of those who listen.The production is configuredas a digital voice soundscape with a one-shot, aerial-view video of abilliard table in play (featuring international champion billiard playerJaime Bedoya). Streams of sound, words and disembodied voices evokerepetitions and pulses between memory, affect and influence, murmuringsoftly of a broken long term love affair, of war, intrigue andexile.

The text is not a product of depression but a dramatic poemwhere words are decanted by disillusionment, a solo symphony at 4:48 am,the happy hour when clarity pays a visit. In this production, the voice-along with music and fragmented images- is configured in space as a poeticsound installation. Three voices are present: that of a fragmented mind,that of a woman in love with absence, and the soft psychiatric voice ofreason.

The story metaphoricallyunravels as an intercultural, theatrical and human experience: a man fromanother world appears one day, fallen from the sky into the backyard ofPelayo, a villager, and his wife, Elisenda. The production is, for bothcompanies, an experience of alterity and difference, where an experimentaltheater from the 'new continent' searches in the traditions of populartheater from the 'thousand-year-old continent,' looking for thrivingritual forms and a 'total language' capable of illuminating the dark pathsof contemporary theater, while the ancient epic art of Theru Koothudiscovers in the works of a contemporary playwright and in the gaze of MapaTeatro's theater the possibility to explore new horizons and revitalize itsown tradition. According to Mapa Teatro, the experience revealed 'apost-dramatic theatrical form approaching pre-dramatic forms andvice-versa, creating a dialogue between past and present over the space ofthe performance itself.’ Approx. first 20 min. of this videodocumentation is dedicated to backstage pre-performance activitiesfollowing various actors through parts of their preparation routine indrinking coffee, applying make-up and sitting about a large room together.A brief interview with Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatrocontextualizes their working relationships, while actors sit behind themapplying make-up to their faces and skin in the background. The videoconcludes with two fragments of the performance recorded by two differentcameras. One of the foremost artistic companies in Colombia, Mapa Teatro (www.mapateatro.org) has been producing theater, performance and art installation projects since 1984. Founders and directors, Rolf and Heidi Abderhalden have created a wide ranging repertoire of theater, opera, mixed-media performance, and site-specific installation. Their work proposes richly textured visual metaphors in which they consider often complex psychological, social and political relationships. Committed to experimentation, and less interested in the actor as an ‘agent of fiction,’ they describe their project as ‘a laboratory of social imagination,’ that offers a space for presenting community issues and human concerns in media and performance. This combination of real-life situations and sites along with highly stylized aesthetic staging produces a tension between real action and (re)presentation. Mapa Teatro draws from live events captured on video such as the demolition of a neighborhood in Bogotá, ritual practice, and texts that explore the relationship of postmodern subjects, myth and metaphor.

A free-wheeling adaptation and distortion of Euripides ‘The Bacchae D69’ is notable for the combination of a number of ‘firsts’ for the New York theater, including audience participation, man-to-man kissing, and full-frontal nudity of both women and men.  The Performing Garage was filled with platforms and towers, the floor covered with carpets. There were no seats which meant that performers and spectators shared the space, sitting on the floor or perched on scaffolds. ‘D69’ was created during a long period of workshops and rehearsals. The production – like all of Schechner’s work that followed – was never finished. Before each performance, Schechner gave extensive notes and made many revisions. Over the 14-month run, the roles were rotated among the cast, including a woman playing the god Dionysus (Joan MacIntosh). The Performance Group used their performances as a means of confronting the psychic, physical, social, and political work of the performer and the spectator. The film was made by De Palma and his colleagues from footage shot during two in June and July, 1968. The film uses two screen images shown simultaneously to give some feel of the totally inclusive environmental theater technique pioneered by Schechner. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice.

In ‘The Tooth of Crime’ Shepard  draws on popular/mythic figures and motifs of the American imaginary such as the cowboy, the rock star, the girl friend, the disc-jockey, and the drifter-outsider. The language of the play is rhythmic with a richness of alliteration and syncopation that The Performance Group actors further embroidered through their verbophysical techniques to produce harmonies, tensions, and emotional and physical states. The drama embodies the contradictions inherent in a star system that creates ‘personalities’ only to discard them when they are no longer commercially productive. Using their own version of rock music, TPG explores in a complex physical environment a world of gangsters and urban cowboys. The performance presents a myriad of comic book characters that underscore the deceptions and failures of the ‘American Dream.’ The subtleties of the characterization, environmental theater mise-en-scene, music, and movement make this production unique. Because the environment makes viewing all of the action from one place impossible, spectators flow with the action from one part of the theater to another.

Food preparation and consumption is the ruling metaphor for the destructive appetites of Western expansion culminating in both the Nazi crime of genocide and the post-industrial excesses of globalization and genetic manipulation. Schechner and his colleagues rework the story. Mephistopheles played by a woman dressed as a man but not disguising her ‘actual’ gender is assisted by Hitler, also played by a woman. Part One of ‘Faust/gastronome’ draws heavily on Goethe, tracing Faust’s seduction of Gretchen (aided by Mephistopheles) and his abandoning her to her death. A considerable portion of the dialogue is Goethe’s, performed in German. Part Two Schechner describes as a ‘tragedy of development.’ Here Faust heads the ‘Fist Group’ of corporations involved in genetic engineering and global exploitation. Just before his death and damnation, Faust meets Gretchen who has come to seek him out and help bring him to hell. At one point, Hitler’s architect, Albert Speer, appears on a talk show justifying World War II and the Holocaust. Later, Faust and a neo-Nazi teenage appear on the same show. The set features three sturdy wooden tables used in many configurations to contain the action. On a platform upstage, composer Ralph Denzer leads a small jazz ensemble. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.","Schechner, Richard, | East Coast Artists| Faust| Gastronome| Power politics","Richard Schechner",,

Michele Minnick and Paula Murray Cole lead the workshop in a yoga warmup, intensive breathing and vocal exercises, slow-motion and other exercises invented or adapted by Schechner, and finally the rasaboxes. Taken as a whole, the workshop is an exploration of psycho-physical embodiments connecting the personal to the social. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach that begins with finding a particular form for the eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theatre manual, Bharata’s ‘Natyasastra.’ In the workshop documented in the film, four student participants along with the instructors commence with a warm up and then draw words and pictures in each of eight connected rectangular boxes mapped out on the floor with masking tape. The ninth, the center box, is left blank because it represents ‘shanta,’ the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud’s call for the actor to be ‘an athlete of the emotions.’ The eight, or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear, horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion), raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss). Workshop participants move within the boxes, jumping from one emotional state to the other and at times engaging interactively.
